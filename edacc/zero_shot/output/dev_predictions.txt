hello my participant number is c 2 p one hello my participant number is c 2 p 2 this is c 2 p one starting to read the passage and this is c 2 p 2 read in the passage please call stella ask her to bring these things with her from the store 6 spoons of fresh snow peas 5 thick slabs of blue cheese and maybe a snack for her brother bob we also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids yep that is good it is a very weird passage is not it quite i think it is designed to you know stretch your pronunciation skills okay so maybe we decided we would talk a bit about where we would want to go on holiday on holiday or yeah what would you like c 2 p 2 so i would love to visit africa because it is the only continent i have never visited i have actually been to africa and i have been to tanzania and i have been to malawi 0 yes it was just before the pandemic so and it was a trip that had been planned for quite some time it was with my parish and they have a project there so they wanted to you know sort of how should i say strengthen their ties again with the project and we went there for a actually it was 2 projects and how were tanzania and malawi that was very interesting it was a very different lifestyle very different way of living very different even the environment in this is very rural it reminded me a bit of how malta was you know ages ago possibly although you know i barely remember it like that but yeah and what sounds different lifestyle well it was much more relaxed it was much more in the evening for example everyone is just outside you know it is not like now where everyone is just sitting in front of their tv that is beautiful thank you it was beautiful yeah and then there were the savannah the not savannahs it is not savannah it is the safaris  in the jungles or savannah yeah actually and that was really amazing what animals did you see did you have a chance to see yeah yeah we actually so we spent i think a whole day trying to chase lions in the sense trying to see lions and we did not manage but we saw elephants we saw giraffes monkeys one monkey almost attacked me but anyway 0 yes come i was feeding them which is not supposed to be done but anyway it is my fault so yeah it is not that you are not supposed to it is at your own risk and in fact it was at my own risk yeah because i was feeding one and then all the others came yeah so that is the thing you but yeah it was interesting what about you where would you like to go so you said africa where are some of the places you have been i have been outside of europe i have been to japan i have lived in japan for 6 months 6 months that is it is a very interesting place i would like to go back i have very good memories from my time in japan why were you in japan you for 6 months i was living in tokyo and while i was there i visited kyoto hiroshima and osaka i and i have heard of that i think i know okinawa i was going to visit okinawa not osaka no they are quite different they are quite different difference and see you next time so okinawa is in the south of japan in in japan and it is an island and it is tropical it is quite far away from mainland japan i mean from the main islands and it is tropical the weather is hot always warm and apparently it is very beautiful because it has white beaches and it is a huge tourist attraction ah the food yes so what is the food like actually i know that you know sort of the most famous food in japan is sushi but i think they actually have a lot of other things that people yeah really i think that peace i think sushi and sashimi are just a cliche but japanese do not spend the whole time eating sushi and sashimi as in the same way as italians do not spend the whole  i am eating pizza what is the difference between social and social media so sashimi is the raw fish thank you is used in is one of the ingredients of sushi okay so sashimi is the raw fish on its own without rice while sushi is sashimi on rice okay thank you so what other food do they have then and even concerning sushi there is different kinds there that we can not find in europe because there is much more variety of fish z so my favorite one is a particular kind of seal but i have never found it in europe you tried to die yes i tried it there it was really good and apart from sushi i mean okay sushi is one dish one of their dishes but then there is they have a 1000000 ways to cook fish also they have a lot of ways to cook meat mostly grilled meat you and they what struck me is that their cuisine is very light light in what sense light and the sense that when a lot of it you do not feel it heavy on your stomach in the uk it happens to me many times that i feel it heavy on my stomach you when eating out very very rarely i felt it on my stomach could it be that they do not fry a lot then it could be although they have tempura which is again and fried dish but even that it was it felt light in the sense probably the i think they have very high standard of food quality very high quality standard for food okay well i mean i mean i have never been to japan i mean the closest i have been is i have been to hong kong which was also amazing and yeah the food there again was wonderful i used to go to the university canteen i was there on a university placement and i used to go to university canteen and i think my most favorite dish was very simple just rice voodoo what we hear called pak choi if i am pronouncing it correctly i am not sure what it is exactly called the chicken sorry not chicken duck on the bone 0 nice and they just chop it in front of you with the cleaver and serve it on just white rice and with some soy sauce and it was delicious sounds really nice and then i want to show yeah see ya how long have you spent in hong kong it was a month i went there on a work placement kind of and it was just in the run up to christmas so and i think that struck me it is also quite not sure if it is classified as tropical but it was quite warm you see a lot of palms the university for example is gorgeous it is built along the side of the university because the campus of the university is basically you know in steps almost because it is going up towards the mountain 0 basically so you know there is a lot of stairways they have a lot of stairs everywhere and it was also the 1st place i think that i saw an outdoor escalator like a very long outdoor escalator an outdoor escalator yes as opposed to one that is in a shopping mall for example 0 and that is in the university campus well not just at the university campus even in the streets that is what i meant like in the streets 0 that is what i meant in doing the various examples that is expected i mean you know are they very common the outdoors escalators yeah yeah because you have to because it is a lot of ups and downs you so it is the island the main island is very hilly so yeah it is everything is you are going up and down up and down sorry go on yeah yeah yeah ask are there a lot of skyscrapers there are depending on which island you go to yes the harbor especially you see a lot in the harbor area and even where all the buildings are quite high  you know 10 12 15 stories at least you ironically the streets reminded me a lot of malta to be honest because it is very narrow roads and high buildings much more higher buildings much higher you are buildings but sort of the same kind of you know construction what have you but yeah hong kong was beautiful i did also manage to go a bit to see some of the adjoining islands that form part of the you know what was you know arciparagus you yes well it is not going to be an archipelago it is archipelagos anyway but yeah how many islands are there i have no idea there is quite a few i mean i think there is about 3 or 4 main islands and then there is the part that is connected to the mainland to mainland china huh but then there is quite a few islands in fact there is a lot of ferry tours to individual islands i think i spent one or 2 days just going around some of the islands nice obviously during the weekend i could go there do things because i was mostly you know we were working towards a competition so we had you know some very tight deadlines so sometimes i was even working saturdays  and but it was a fun trip yeah i have got fond memories there and how were you able to get by speaking english yeah hong kong is very english friendly it was a former colony so it is very anglicized but at the same time you see a lot of the chinese culture you it is very very strong actually the chinese culture there there is a lot of temples lots of you know there are ways of living and what have you but it is very anglicized so almost all the young people especially the speak english you i was obviously in the university setting so yeah there is a lot of english there actually yeah how was it in japan with regards to english there it is not that easy in the sense that in the university everyone spoke english however in tokyo you could find people who speak english but outside of the main city it is quite difficult to find an english speaker i mean it was similar in hong kong as in the main city you get by with english and when talking to youngsters but as soon as you go into the outskirts it is the same thing but the signs at least were also mostly in english as well so because of that you know you get by yeah they did have english signs or okay signs written in the latin alphabet okay okay and then after hong kong you went to shanghai well not not after but i did i did go to shanghai as well i went for a friend is wedding and it was actually quite interesting as well the food in shanghai was much more oily much sweeter you it was a bit too much for me in fact for example the hong kong cuisine it agreed more with me you but yeah it was no no shanghai was beautiful as well i mean it is a very westernized city as well as shanghai bye i did climb the the one of the tallest towers in the world we the shanghai tower and you can go up to the top floor and get the whole view i think it is i think it is the highest observation deck in the world how many meters is it i have no idea i would need to look it up but yeah i think it is not the highest tower in the world but it is the highest observation deck okay if i am not mistaken in the world or at least it was when i went i do not know if there is anything changed since then all right and would you like to go back to hong kong yeah i mean i mean all these places i really enjoyed them and you know you can only see so much in when you are there i mean it is it is it is i mean hong kong i had a month okay but still there was so many things i did not see yeah yeah yeah that same with shanghai i was only there for a few days there were a lot of things in japan i did not see i would love to go back so what would your most favorite part of japan be well i love kyoto because there is a lot of temples and a lot of history there  and tokyo is nice because it is huge and there is a lot of every quarter in tokyo is different so you can basically find everything you can find the temples you can find the westernized quarter you can find the fish market  so you can find anything nature is really beautiful especially in the autumn they have the day there there are if you get a bit away they have a lot of maple trees and they all turn orange in the autumn and peace wonderful and unfortunately i missed the cherry blossoms in in the spring because i i went there in may when when and it was too late for that i would love to visit okinawa which is the south of japan the very south at the southernmost and i would like to visit hokkaido which is the northernmost point and and yeah japan is very long so the hokkaido at the north is very cold apparently while okinawa is tropical while tokyo was very very mild summer was quite hot but autumn was extremely mild is the city walkable or do you have to take public transport know as huge so you you you can not walk around you need to take public transport and is it efficient or it is very efficient and there is you can get basically everywhere by metro or by train the only problem is that the metro shuts between midnight and 5 the you have those 5 hours where there is no public transport or well no metro and probably there there are local buses but i never tried because it is less easy to navigate for me who did not speak japanese but yeah the trains are very efficient they are always on time and there is train stations everywhere okay i think with that we can wrap up you this is c 2 p one turning off the recording (EDACC-C01-00)
0 ready do i have to click 0 hi okay so my participant number is c 8 p 2 and i think so i have not checked so i am just trusting you on this so i have to read the following passage out loud okay do we want more time hi my participant number is c 8 p one i still do not know how zoom works even after all this time i tried to have it because i had it with my institutional account but every time i tried to change it they said that i need to change my email or link my personal email to change the zoom account and this has been going for around a year since i joined the uni that is why i prefer to use teams because you can just search people up and score them bye much easier than like creating a link and then send the link and the actual thanks a lot and all the blah blah blah yeah that is not that easy to understand anyway but i think teams is not that good sometimes i guess yeah i do have pros and cons or i have some some people that said like no i kind of joined teams i do not know how that works i literally just have to click the link so easy some people do not even use i know some older professors who do not even like to use emails at all it takes them like a month to reply so what they do i do not know i do everything on paper i do not even know how to do statistical analysis and stuff i thought you were saying like thank you they even use email if you do not use email do you use r like if you teach psychology do you use r you said everything by post pigeons i mean you can still have posts here so that is a good thing yeah we had this conversation before yeah that is still that is a thing what sending the review by post yeah yeah bye you can send lots of things with post even the general subscriptions they still have the paper versions 0 yeah by papervation not like the review of the manuscript that you are working on sending it corrections by post i had writing things no i hope not i hope not but i know that my partner identifiable not a smile okay they send some sort of random email like please i need some help like just filtering stuff in excel and stuff and then they pay you just i know that it is not just for doing this i want to get paid helping you filter out sheets i love spreadsheets no they are not good i am not very good at excel but i do love filtering but you can do filtering in many other things instead of excel i do not know if you received some sort of excel on that kind of things in office when you were in high school bye i do not know i have never learned i have never learned properly never ever now they are not properly i used to have a course literally every every term or every year when i was in high school we got this computational skills course that you need to pass and you have like 2 hours of that how to turn on the computer it was more like filtering what they do they are like this is the start button you have to press the start button and then login and then this is how to use the mouse yeah but then i do not know if it was more advanced or not they tried to teach us how to use macros or macros in excel and how to use it 0 i do not know what that is and there is another another software that i do not remember that it was really useful for big datasets that are not excel but it was purple i just remember the icon that was purple i remember you no no no no another one for really big datasets do not know i do not remember i can only use r from the start when i was born i was using it exactly that is what i was for because i was genius yeah i still can not do anything yeah but i am trying to learn python because every single if you look at the cvs of every single person out there they know at least like 3 languages and a few very stupid only one thing it is pretty basic that everybody knows i think you need to understand that you already speak 2 human languages nah it does not matter i do not think that is such a big deal because a lot of people from mainland european countries they speak at least 2 or 3 languages at home anyway for example if your mom and dad are from different countries and they also speak english then that is 3 already okay yeah like my partner he wants to i do not know how many languages he speaks yeah how many languages does he speak well his native is german but the local dialect is swiss german and then he also learned english from a very young age and because he is swiss you still have to learn at least 2 other languages that they speak in the country like french or italian or something else and then he went to norway and then he learned norwegian there so he knows i do not even know how many languages i think it depends if you qualify and then you categorize how much do you know from a language because no matter how many languages you speak it does not matter no not how you speak but how fluent you are yes how fluent you are you yeah the proficiency also it is not like you know you do not know it is on a spectrum everything is on a spectrum the same with pythons and all the other languages i guess i am somewhere right here about what yeah because yeah there is many others that just have the bold or disappeared or you know it but it is a combination of many other languages   yeah i do not know there is a conference i am going to they have got like another version of it so it is like acm but they have got another version and it is for linguistics only and that looks quite fun what is that language again it is acl advanced something for linguistics and yeah i am quite interested but i can not go to 5 conferences one is way too many i mean you could if everything is online i just do not bad practice i just do not want to go travel around that is like one of the perks for what we do we get to travel and we can get paid for as long as you do not go to like 10 i mean ask for money for 10 things well yeah thank you i know everyone that has got into phd sometimes i am like yeah this is kind of the thing travel and meet people but we are not experienced anything throughout the pandemic and i am like okay yeah yeah i think i got quite lucky because for i graduated undergrad when pandemic happened and then got into phd when pandemic sort of not over but a lot more loose than before so i think i got the best and and both views like experience the pandemic also starting yeah i feel quite bad for the year both me and they sort of just stuck at home for like an entire year yeah yeah that does not help at all depends if you like it i like to be stuck at home yeah but i mean from the educational experience 0 yeah definitely a totally different level yeah i am a very strong believer that any some sort of communal or community experience based on the location and even the work every everything is just for the social interaction because you can work by your own 15 minutes no no yet we have still 5 minutes to go yes what else we can talk about  because they have problems like these things what is the memory of your childhood i am not talking about memories i mean it is the memories of your childhood to be fair you are not a therapist when you were a kid what kinds of games did you use to play is there any one or one that you remember well i was a strange kid i brought up that question like did i used to play i do not think i used to play any games i still do not play games you counted the stairs but no i was a very strange kid i do not know probably yes we are all estranged in our own way 0 another one did you have a favorite book or film or tv show or cartoon as a child what was i used to watch quite a lot of tom and jerry nice i do not remember what i used to like 0 yeah i used to watch a lot of dragon ball i am sorry because that was the only thing that passed during the tv that we repeated over and over and over again literally 0 is that why you like anime no not at all and i did not know that that was anime at that time to be honest we were just watching with my brother because that was something that was playing on the tv on a sunday morning instead i of watching the mass or people talking about many of the things that we did not understand so we watched that cartoon because it was the only free cartoon that we can watch i am like that i do remember that that was a very popular anime but i was not really into it but i remember the kids around me they were pretty interested in seeing similar shows but i was not i just never i have never really been very into it so now i see it i am like i do not get the hype but it is so popular i do not get hype i think there is many cultural perspectives of why that is popular or not but at least in latin america i do not know we did not know that it was anime but i think it is a very different format it is a very different format yes and then you got this this this cartoon so i think it is dexter or thanks though the magical ground something 0 i thought you mean like the detective show no no there is another one i can not cartoon it is really children friendly or bob squarepants sponge blah i know anyway it is bob squarepants it was fun sponge bars were our pants yes that is what i meant very long night that kind of shows that there was the one that used to show on tv or power rangers but that is not a cartoon but i think that was pretty popular i remember me and my brother squeezing just to see power rangers we watched genome pop the builder yes but that was quite annoying for me and i want to we were watching it in class to study gender stereotypes love come down and then our teacher i was at school i was doing a loads and our teacher he literally brought a cassette because it was so old that it was on cassette and he also had to bring a cassette player to show us look at that no no probably i was already like in middle school when bob happened i or probably i yeah yeah yeah because i only remember this sensation of why of these shows about the trains i do not know if you know like there is a really creepy train i do not even want to face on it yes i do not understand children like if i were a kid and i watched those i am going to get nightmares yes hey arnold hey arnold was okay but i do watch quite a lot of detective shows and i am still okay i think like which ones i am quite messed up for a child like even for the normal shows that we watch at our age but i was watching it at quite young age do not know if that was legal or not identify the information that is okay well we almost done we made like 13 seconds and that will do and hopefully i am not going to do a countdown my what a countdown 10 9 0 no it is not 10 yes it is 15 14 13 take it right to the bench like what rocket launch ah no but already this 10 passed 4321 we did it yay that is it let us see let us stop the recording (EDACC-C04-00)
all right i am participant c 13 p one and i am participant c 13 p 2 okay now i have to read out this text so again but participant c 13 p one reading this out please call stella ask her to bring these things with her from the store 6 spoons of fresh snow peas 5 thick slabs of blue cheese and maybe a snack for her brother bob we also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids she can scoop these things into 3 red bags and we will go meet her wednesday at the train station that was a bit of a tongue twister please call stella ask her to bring these things with her from the store 6 spoons of fresh snow peas 5 big slabs of blue cheese and maybe a snack for her brother bob we also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids she can scoop these things into 3 red bags and we will go meet her wednesday at the train station alright so now we can just go into normal conversation you which we have not had all day so we can actually have a nice relaxing conversation right now so how is work as actually all right and  a bit boring i mean i like when it is kind of boring because i do not especially like when it is early in the morning i am so tired and so i did not have to like go for a social support with anyone today bye because we had like 4 people on the shift bye and then like who was there becca becca is jamie and maya they all exported out different people and i just stayed in the service you to and i did some like more like admin work ppe like ppe check and i sent it to her manager i also spoke to the manager she came over and we discussed like the recent incident a little bit she asked like how this affected me and and i also like asked her if i can get some extra shifts because i have a little bit more time now which when we are like finals over yeah yeah i did shopping for one person i am not mostly i did some admin work and we had a bit of a laugh with the staff you it is actually nice good yeah it always feels really weird for me when i am on a day shift 9 to 5 or 10 to 6 whatever  i am so used to being on a sleepover so just staying in the service for the whole day whole night until the next day and i just kind of by habit wanted to sign the handover sheet because we have these safe keys that we always use if to each other for one person finishing sleepovers give you the person starting the sleepover and i and we need to sign that you get the keys and i just wanted to sign it by just because i do it usually bye but i was like no actually i can go home tonight so that was nice and i was going to mention because usually every time you tell me that you are going to go to work it is like because of the whole 24 hour thing i expect that okay right now you would still be at work and then tomorrow in the afternoon you tell me i got free now i am free soon but it is weird that you started in the morning and you are free now which is how the average person works but with you it is the 24 hour shift nice is my friend at work said that last month she did 8 sleepovers i think so she is knackered but she is happy that she is going to have a lot of money now   yeah true there was actually another slip over available tomorrow with us  someone cannot do it and i was really tempted to take it just like you know for extra cash you but i can not tomorrow because i am seeing 2 other friends tomorrow you and we planned that a long time ago so i am not going to you know just change our plans because it is really difficult to you to find the same time that will be available for everyone i mean you picked up quite a few shifts anyway so i mean i think it should be fine yeah you do not want to over tire yourself because then it would be difficult to do all that dissertation work yeah but i was thinking maybe actually because i am always hesitant to pick up shifts because i am thinking because in my mind i keep thinking 0 i do not want to go for the holiday to work but then i am i am but it is not a sleepover it is just like a day shift thank you to speak up for hours or 3 hours if i do not want to do the full 8 hours could you do that too and i do not know that yeah they are so flexible now because they are desperate for people to help would that also apply if i am working there and then if i just thank you okay well you wow geez i did not know that i thought the minimum was like an 8 hour shift like even if it is not 9 to 5 but 8 hours minimum i mean that is like officially but all these things like sorry for cutting off but all these things and we will see you next time would have to be decided like the month before right like when they ask you to give your times and blah blah and then you would say today i looked at the rota what shifts were outstanding what was available all right and i and you know i was like 0 actually i could work next week this extra she is shift and i just emailed my manager about that and added it to the router yeah yeah so i do not know maybe like in between my trips in june  i could pick up some extra because i do not want to be i do not want to feel so financially insecure bye everyone especially with the trips i am going to spend more money on going for a dinner or whatever like having restaurant food or going for a drink so so that is going to be extra costs  you yeah fair enough yeah also because you are going to come later tonight what do you want i can not remember what we want to add to the curry i am going to go to the shop was it peppers bacon and i think it is bacon 1st baby corn yeah thank you yeah peppers baby corn the green beans you mentioned yeah and and bye napa yeah yeah if we can get a cheap can of that yeah i mean maybe because like the whole pineapple actually is usually quite cheap to buy sometimes it is like of the nuisance i have a sharp knife so i could manage you can be making the other stuff as well so it will take time i see how i feel  like the actual pineapple like the fresh one you will be more firm the one from the can is quite soft and mushy in a way if you know what i mean yeah yeah i mean it should be should be fine but i think it is really be fine i do not even know how that band is going to taste the tesco on because because i have never tried that and thai curry paste before i have tried different other thai curry paste but not like the tesco brand one and then i will they are all different so yeah now let us see how that is okay so what did you do today so far i was at the cafe with my thesis partner we were just working on the thesis way i think it is pretty decent to be honest like even though i told you you know somewhere in the middle like things were getting quite slow and everything because of the assessments now and it is still slow like in the sense that it is quite delayed but certain things that we want to get done when we do meet each other we are able to get it done to at least some extent which is good  it is not like we just sat there and then nothing happens so it is it was quite productive i would say today  got some code running cold on call tracks okay hey not not not not ours you know thank you okay what caught you interested and also we wanted to do this one thing where if you are playing a if you open up a questionnaire and then you are playing some track  we did not want people to have the option to move around the track like if it is a 32nd track they can just skip wherever they want  i wanted it to be like an autoplay thing so the minute you open it the thing the song just starts right thanks for watching and we do not want to let participants go to the next one without completing that so until that song finishes you let me rephrase when the song finishes then the button appears to go next ah it is okay yeah so there is there is some code that you need for that which you we checked up online and there was somebody that was asking about videos we did not we did not have to do anything with videos but we use the same thing but with audio file bye  i do not know what else happened yeah i mean that was most of the most of the day so far and then after that went to the gp got my knee checked up and i said i should just go for physiotherapy and everything else he said was i do not know stuff i guess i guess i already knew or or maybe he was confused i am not sure because he did not seem to know too much about what was going on i tried to explain it as well as i could telling him how you on exactly i guess he did not know what was going on either so but it is fine he said that you know just give it another couple of weeks it might take a little longer to heal up but he did like i said recommend physiotherapy for later on maybe not now but he said that you know again if you he is like even if it gets better like what if you want to do roller skating or rollerblading later on and what if it is fine then what if the whole thing it happens all over again so he is like i would give that he is like the waiting list is long but at least you could try it out again maybe  other than that i am just in my dorm right now and i am going to head out in a while maybe like half an hour later  or drum and hurdles how long was the appointment the appointment not too long i mean i i i was called at i mean the appointment time was 3 30 i got there just before that like literally a minute or 2 before for that probably called in at around 3.40 and i was in for about 10 minutes maybe i think he was trying to find out other calls he was asking me do you have this problem that problem i was like yeah a bit of this a bit of that but i was like i do not think it has got anything to do with this particular problem and i will see you next time and i was explaining why exactly they looked at my previous reports as well and then and of course i do not blame him he is trying to figure it out so obviously he is going to ask me for more questions well but yeah i i can not say it was a complete waste i got some information out of it but that was i was just hoping to get a little more insight into what was going on  it is a confusing thing sorry i do not know we will see what happens the way i am not sure if you are for a couple of weeks was it the same gp that you always see or was it a different one no i mean i have only seen 2 people including him so far bye so i have only been to the gp once before and that was some other guy you and then this guy was was different you may seem i am sorry i guess he just did not know what to really say because i mean the way even when i explained it to him he told me that you know this this should have been gone and you should not have pain right now but we said you know for some people it is different you know the healing processes take the healing process can take longer that is that might just be your case but of course he was 100% sure so we will see in a couple of weeks time bye i think i am bad though really well but yeah like i said and then after this in a while i am going to leave and then i have drum rehearsals and that is for like 2 hours and then after that we can meet and make the thai curry do you want to continue watching what was the rat race or the dancing which one yeah either i am cool with either and there are actually a couple of other movies i think  i can not remember yeah i mean honestly either let us see how the what what what the whatever the curry smell inspires yeah  because erotra is more of like a comedy kind of thing i have a little action and there is a bit of mystery as well because you do not know who is really going to i mean how it is going to end and that is it i think it is like romantic yeah do you like actually do you like because you never mentioned about any when you talk about movies like you never bye the imaginary romantic comedies or other romantic movies is usually they watch comedy or something yeah i think i used to prefer comedy with i do not mind some rom coms like they are fine yeah some of them are i can not really i do not have any at the top of my mind right now but some of them are great it is just that with me i would be more inclined towards just comedy or just mystery thank you or maybe horror or those kinds of genres all right i are you not scared of horrors what i am not scared of horror i am i that is why i love it right that is the whole point of it if you just sit with a big tv screen or on your laptop as well and you want something which is under the category of horror and you just sit there i mean you do not enjoy that time the whole joy is to watch something and then like scream can you watch it yourself no you crazy no no bye holy shit and no i would have to watch it with somebody i mean i could watch it alone i just prefer to not not to there is more of a i will be long yeah there is more of a i like the harmony like when you are watching it with a group and everybody is scared you know  i do not like watching the kind of people that just are like you know every time something scary is going to come they try to divert themselves or they try to say something out loud to reduce the creepiness i do not like that i like everybody to scream at once yeah sometimes people would comment during the movie and there would be some kind of mystery scene and they would make joke about it and and like ruin the vibe the atmosphere thank you of the scariness kind of yeah that happened to me actually in a cinema 0 were watching it was kind of horror but also not like not like a typical horror and i think it was called heritage i am sorry i do not know if you have heard i have a very bad and yeah you it is actually a great movie but my friends started sometimes would make some comments and that would make me laugh and then i guess i got into this vibe as well and i was making i am kind of a hypocrite here because i started making these jokes too obviously yeah i have more to say on this but i think we have gone above well above the 15 minutes i forgot and but i am going to stop this recording but we will continue this conversation on call right now thank you (EDACC-C07-00)

these things into 3 red bags and we will go meet her wednesday at the train station okay now for a regular conversation so would you rather go to the beach today or do pub golf discuss i mean realistically i would rather go to the beach today yeah the weather is actually quite nice i feel like we have not had something like this we have had like one day of sun in like 3 weeks you know i mean obviously but it has been i would rather go right now as well as everybody is doing there and pop those to be a little bit grim yeah especially in this time staying inside yeah that is true i mean we could just go after this you know what is stopping us i mean we could after this yeah i do not say everybody is like saying 0 yeah go bourbon all that stuff like somebody really cares i keep on going bourbon 0 my god that sounds atrocious it sounds really grim i would not want to go there another night at roscoe is no never again i know you are a big you are the big big promoter there but yeah yeah of course well the big promoter is right here with me and we please do not ever mention that ever again yeah no well it is kind of funny to think they will be analyzing this conversation but anyway yeah 0 i am seeing a great i am seeing a great question here not going to lie it is question it says there are particular foods you used to like as a child i am quite tempted by that okay tell me about a particular food you used to like when you were a child then i mean i mean i mean depends when because i think when i was in ukraine i would definitely say it was like the dumplings divided okay roguie yeah peter peter is like more polish i would say why actually are they like all these all these all these dumplings of eastern european origin i mean they are just all just realistically they are all just like lamb or beef or pork with stuffed with herbs which i mean depends obviously by different mean depending where you are from but it is really realistically that with a very thick outer crust and most of the time you will have cream sour cream with them and they are so good they are delicious that does sound pretty good if i had not just eaten an entire pepperoni pizza i could definitely scran a few of those i do not have that you must have that in romania like some form or version of it they are not really big when they are dumplings actually you know yeah the closest thing we have is something called sarmadas but it is not like a dumpling it is like wrapped in those like banana leaves you know yeah so it is like beef or mince or whatever but it is wrapped in the leaves and then you the leaves not banana leaves i do not know why i said that cabbage right yeah yeah cabbage cabbage leaves and like you boil the leaves and you cook the meat and then you wrap them in and it is like a dumpling but with a leaf on the outside and then you eat that with like sour cream and stuff and that is pretty good 0 my god that actually i think what we eat at christmas for some reason i have no idea it is not a christmas food but it is just my grandmother my dad okay the way my mom is mother makes them reminds my dad a lot of the way his mom used to make them that is any and he is always like 0 you can not find them authentically made here so it does not bother but she likes the way she does them so he will just eat like loads of those at christmas like i have never we have not done a christmas turkey for like 10 years it is always just a bunch of romanian food for some reason you watch die hard as well for christmas which is honestly the best family television who cares yeah no it is great started like maybe like 5 or 6 years ago my sister was like 0 let us watch die hard and then i said i never watched it everyone goes 0 and yeah it is the best tradition is that just a you thing being like very special i think it is quite an american thing watching die hard it is like you watch home alone or the scrooge mcduck one whatever that is called or die hard but i remember a few years ago there was one time where we watched die hard one and everyone kind of like fell asleep from a food coma and then my dad was like okay he just put on die hard 2 so he watched die hard one at like 40 clock and then about 20 minutes into die hard 2 i just passed out and i fell asleep on the couch and this was like 6.30 i wake up around midnight he is an absolute specimen he should not be let out of the house yeah i do not know that was a great christmas i think that was like the 1st corona christmas he just fully lost it these things actually like fucking lost it throughout corona it is like 0 my god almost certainly went a tad insane i mean any man would lose would is insane when they watch die hard 4 not going to lie yeah you can actually watch bruce willis get like more and more bald as the films go through it is quite fun you can just track the male pattern boldness on the tv screen 0 i just saw someone outside with the new have you seen the new like airpod headphones what no never in my life you should look them up after this but they are really bookey they are like they have that like old like 80s fancy headphone like hi fi design but they are like 600 quid as well but apparently they are really good also you know like a complete tool wearing them people said that about airpods everybody is wearing that right now that is true that is very true have you ever like people that you people when they 1st came out people mocked them so hard and now they are just i was one of i used to mock them everywhere and here i am to be fair i remember when i 1st got a pair of earbuds it is like cause i tried the like the like back then beats had some like wireless earbuds and stuff and they have probably gotten a lot better now but the like sony ones back in 2016 or whatever they were complete shit they were falling out of your ears and they were all they hurt they were it is just like connected to my phone easy peasy exactly and as well as that like 0 my god like you can literally like do walk i think like 10 meters something like that and nobody cares like it is going to be fun yeah remember that brings up remember the whole like google glasses thing that came out that whole thing that was so dumb yeah i never worked out why that did not actually become a big thing i remember smosh made a video where they like yeah the hell out of it but then they never actually made them probably because number one probably like a tool just wearing that and 2nd of all you just i am also almost certain that like every single person all the like lab rats they had doing them got some kind of like retinal cancer or something probably they probably have like google their vision was just ruined and google probably hushed them just now there is no google glass because nobody is tried to like do it ever since yeah they did look pretty dumb i mean yeah you look like an absolute tool walking around with that but it is fine i am not going to judge let us see what else we have in the old prompt section beautiful questions did you have a favorite book or film or tv show or cartoon as a child what was it about 0 absolutely adventure times you privacy all the way on the police adventure times to this day to this day adventure time supremacy it is pretty great it is amazing what have you ever seen like as a kid watching that coming back from school i just watched that that was amazing adventure time i read this book when i was a kid called do you ever read this jang the phantom tollbooth i have heard of that i have heard of that it is like a very very quickly it is a very classic like 8 year old boy book it is super fucking jarring because it is basically about this kid that goes into like an alternate dimension where maths there is like a bunch of weird superheroes that all have like math power there is like a math wizard and stuff yeah and there was this one kid who would just go around like floating in mid air of course and the main character sees him and he goes why are you floating in midair and he says you know how when you grow up as you get taller your like vantage point is constantly changing throughout the years because you are getting taller and taller and he says he comes from a species where everyone starts with their head where it ends up and your legs just go down and eventually touch the ground and they go that makes way more sense because now i always look at things the same way i am just trying to imagine a primary school teacher trying to explain to kids that this is somehow normal imagine being a primary school teacher and all these like 6 year old boys who will grow up to be d one athletes they are just like hovering way above you and you are like it is like what are you doing but imagine like that child is like imagine like the children are like super small they are just going to be like the foot level of the d one yeah just like football with their head floating about yeah what about what was like your i can see it is a very like big movie man what was like your like formatting movie as a kid as a kid i do not know that is quite tough i feel like i probably did watch loads of movies as a kid but a lot of them were just like dumb like disney films and stuff yeah i used to love the gym carry me with a mask 0 the mask is so 0 that is so funny i think i have watched that like 20 times over the years amazing the scene where he starts dancing and does the little conga routine 0 my god bye i just lose it soundtrack too it is so good yeah it is great soundtrack is amazing and he has so many goofy noises and moments and stuff with his hammers and his explosions it reminds me i remember watching as a kid like the whole like i remember my teacher showed me the what was it again the wizard of oz and i like learned like 10 years later yeah massive amounts of skin cancer from the mercury and the paints because the lighting was so poor are the actual actors yeah yeah that is kind of fucked up and like got like massive amounts of radiation damage i can not believe that musical is still running wicked wicked 0 my god yeah i remember watching that i remember being a kid walking around london and you see the lads for that is that in the lion king who is like how can there still be demand how has everyone not watched them already i think it is such a cult thing it is like it is like disney movies like we will just rewatch them whenever so but like in the industry that the they just have to keep it yeah i guess so see that in countries that are not like english speaking like you only ever see that in like and english speaking countries like when have you ever seen that in like cool like i went to see i went to see a performance of mamma mia in greece and it was just like the gayest thing i have ever seen they went super camp with it it was hilarious because you had this like thank you tiny blonde greek girl and there were like 40 dudes because you know how like each of the 3 dudes that thinks it is her dad it is like slightly different like like like colin firth or colin farrell or whatever it is like a businessman and then one of the guys is like a hippie and then one of and then this one guy who is like a bit normal and it always hits this dude is like clearly the father but they just never say it yeah of course i might be completely misremembering but that is what happened in the play anyway bye and i think that was and it was super funny because it was just like in this play it was basically 3 gay dudes all dressed in like sequins with one was like fully purple one was fully black that is great and we will miss for the peak and they would just do all these dances on stage it was hilarious did you understand all of it because a lot of it was just they were just singing the songs 0 what do you say in english where they like adapt it to greek i think most of them they adapted to greek but like the famous ones they kept in english mamma mia they sang in english and what is the one they sing when they are in the ocean like do not go like that one leo you love me i think that one they kept in english finding nemo i do not know finding me right now that is a weird movie that is a movie i have not watched since i was like a little kid and all that it is like you have to watch it leave a dreamy details did you ever see in finding nemo in the swedish one at the very end no i have never actually seen the swedish version of finding nemo i have it either but it is this cold thing at the end i think it is at the end it is like the end of it it just says slut and that is the end of it that is just it is just in one frame it is just the one slug in the ocean it is amazing is that just how you say the end in swedish probably not probably means something in the end imagine watching a really emotional kids movie all of his family died looking for his wife he is met a really special friend and now it is just a slut at the end excellent from it and with that that has been 15 minutes i think we can call it a day excellent conversation it is like a john and joe rogan podcast yeah that was good fun all right come back around i will finish the recording now toodles thank you bye bye (EDACC-C06-00)
hi i am c 7 p one hi i am c 7 p 2 okay so here is the passage please call stella ask her to bring these things with her from the store 6 spoons of fresh snow peas 5 thick slabs of blue cheese and maybe a snack for her brother bob we also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids she can scoop these things into 3 red bags and we will go meet her wednesday at the train station is called stella ask her to bring these things with her from the store 6 spoons of fresh snow peas 5 thick slabs of blue cheese and maybe a snack for her brother bob we also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids she can scoop these things into 3 red bags and we will go meet her wednesday at the train station okay great actually i will ask you a different question this time if you could go on holiday anywhere where would you go and why that is the most difficult question ever okay i want to go everywhere but i guess maybe some specifically famous places that i can think of that i have not been to like in terms of i think the 1st of them is the 7 wonders of the world so for example i have been to the pyramids but i want to go visit really the great wall of china surprisingly i have gone to paris before but i have not actually been to the eiffel tower so that too  but wait no i am remembering there is 2 different sets there is the 7 ancient wonders of the world and then there is the other set so i think the eiffel tower is it was the new one but then what do you call it the pyramids and some other places are in the like ancient version but yeah places places like that have we seen the stonehenge no i have not that is in stonehenge i have forgotten but yeah i know which place you are right yeah because i think that is also a wonder of the world like some kind of mystery i mean no i have not seen it either but like i have seen tours starting from london to stonehenge so maybe one day  what was egypt like india is cool i yeah i liked it because there was lots of cool historical things to see i know that is such a dull answer but yeah because as well as the pyramids and the sphinx we also went to a couple of museums as well and so went to a bunch of restaurants and tried the local cuisine and yeah it was just all around a good trip okay egypt because i would like to go there but i do not know have not had the chance but yeah it looks really interesting and like it is kind of a historical artifact y place because yeah i mean those like ancient egyptians were so smart yeah there were so many what do they call it like they invented lots of things and made lots of cool discoveries dreams you during that time yeah okay i guess i should go now and where do i want to go on holiday i mean okay i honestly want to go to egypt yeah like it is just seems really cool and i have not actually have not been to africa at all or okay so yeah i would say that is like seems like a good starting place i want to go to egypt and then maybe iceland because i always see those really pretty pictures on the internet of like the aura borealis 0 yeah yeah the aura and also like they have just really really weird looking nature y places like they have an ocean no they have a beach that is just black sand no way i have never heard of this before yeah no no they really they have like the craziest they have the craziest nature things and then they also have like what do you call it like volcanoes and i do not know it just looks really strange and like really magical so that is why i am on that it is so cool no i have to go there now yeah no you know like honestly i think it looks just so amazing and but i mean i have so many places that i want to go to i also want to go to like india or like uzbekistan or like i do not know again more ancient civilization places with nice architecture i have not been to the middle east so i should go to the middle east yeah there is too many places to go the world is a big thing i know what was i going to say so do you want to ask a question now okay i will ask you maybe about a favorite book or film or tv show that you had as a child or more recently or something okay what should i say okay i will just go with movie okay right i used to be obsessed with the movie matilda you know that one right 0 yeah i have mentioned this before yeah like with miss trunchbull and stuff but yeah no i was so obsessed with that movie like i would watch it every single day because that was still the dvd time so i would just like you know how kids are like i would just come home every day and put matilda on and watch it again and again and again so yeah i really liked that movie i should actually rewatch it it has been very long since i have rewatched that one and it is like such a heartwarming story you know i get you have a good day what were you guys saying have you seen it 0 no yeah i have seen matilda a couple times bye it was just when you mentioned dvds it was making me think how yeah it was not too long ago that we still watch stuff on dvds or even vhs thank you so much for joining us i am that it is so wild to think that we just stream everything now i think one thing that shocks me honestly in my daily life is just the thought that i am like yeah in my lifetime technology has changed so drastically and i mean i am used to it because like i have grown up with it but i can not imagine if like you know for older generations who experienced technology at a certain time yeah yeah i know i know because i remember being in like the 6th grade and maybe not it was maybe not in the 6th grade but like in elementary school and i was watching tv and they were talking about smartphones for the 1st time and like how smartphones will be released in korea the next year or something and i was actually kind of skeptical like i thought like 0 you know it is not going to like take on i guess but then it it is i mean yeah i mean i guess when i was in elementary school you could still technically access the internet from your phone but it was like super super slow and super complicated and expensive to do that and you could like you could not like google things right you could just i do not know download songs or something but then like in the span of like 23 years we got proper smartphones and yeah i remember when like i remember that yeah but now the technology is so advanced like you can easily do like what 1080 p and yeah honestly like back in the day when you actually had to wait for the video to buffer now i do not remember the last time i saw the buffering site on any streaming site 0 my god i forgot all about that before you signed like the round thing like going around you know on this day maybe it was that not the symbol you saw but like yeah the little circular yeah rotating circular thing icon yeah because yeah i remember that because i remember watching it so this was the time when i did not have a smartphone with my mom did so i was watching the annoying orange video do you know that i was watching the annoying orange video on my mom is phone but it would not load so i was really frustrated and that is a distinct memory i have that is so specific that is so cute i can just imagine many years trying to trying to get the annoying orange to reload there so many of you were kids we used to worry about the most the wildest things because i was literally saying to my parents the other day how i remember when i was younger and i used to read a lot of book series so because of that let us say i finish book 2 in a series or something and then now i need to try and find the next book so so i would check to see if it was in my local library check to see if it was in my school library i like such like high low up and down everywhere you would be possible for this book but then some right right know you know people will be borrowing it or the library does not have it so then i need to like especially request my friends and be like please can i have some money to buy this book so practically every book collection ever apart from some that like maybe i get a book set gifted to me i would just have random like books not in the chronological order so maybe i have the book books 14 and 7 because those are the ones i had to buy because the library did not have them okay 0 man good times yeah good days yeah i remember going to a library a lot like as a kid too like my school library actually had a lot of really good books that i enjoyed reading and i wish the library at our university was a little more like that because i think they only sort of stop the more scholarly books and not for fun books i get what you mean to be honest i have not really explored the library all that much like it was only the other day that i decided to start having a look because i figured as much as we do probably mostly have academic type stuff i was thinking that i am sure they will have some more like leisurely reading type things that maybe i do not know like last time i checked they did not even have harry potter there what or maybe some of the books are not in that library but potentially in another library in the sense that i think some of the as in even if the main library does not have everything i think i think some of the other ones have books that are not yeah yeah maybe that makes sense yeah maybe i wonder if anybody like actually uses the physical books at the library because i honestly never do because like when i use the library services it is to like access online resources right like scans of textbooks rather than books 0 really bye i mean i am kind of the same like i see that like a board i mean i have not but i also used to think that hardly anyone borrowed stuff but i mean i have seen people borrow things and i mean i mean i guess maybe it depends on the degree as well yeah yeah we need you to have the physical copy more than others yeah and i guess like if you are going to read a book from like cover to cover it is a lot better if you have a physical copy because honestly like in my courses i usually just need like one or 2 pages in the middle and never the whole book yeah that is true but i guess that requires the entire thing yeah yeah that has been my experience as well because sometimes i just find it hard to read an ebook like you said thank you just sometimes feels easier when you have the actual book in your hand yeah yeah that is i mean that is definitely true like yeah i mean just the experience is not the same honestly so wait what was i going to say 0 my god so like your exams are over right do you have the one tomorrow no i am finished thankfully 0 great but yeah so i guess yeah that is 3rd year 1st year yeah it was such a whirlwind honestly it has been such a long year yeah so i think we are pretty much done now okay great okay i am going to stop the recording now are you sure you want to stop recording to quote yes (EDACC-C03-00)
hi my participant number is c 33 p one and my participant number is c 33 p 2 okay i will start with the passage please call stella ask her to bring these things with her from the store 6 spoons of fresh snow peas 56 slabs of blue cheese and maybe a snack for her brother bob we also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids she can scoop these things into 3 red bags and we will

once you plan to just gather your key back around 4 pm i run for me so you just go through there to pick up your key and i will meet her at the main library gate uhhhh i think it thank you easier to find so you will go there by bus of course i am so nervous i do not know how to recognize her as we have not met before 0 yeah could be difficult but maybe you can find her by just someone that is kind of trying to find someone yeah looking for someone that by her gestures by her i think it would be precious yeah visual experiences yeah she did not give me her phone number so i can i could only contact her by email milk yeah but there will not be many people around there right yes library the it is february and it is saturday and it is the end of semester everyone finished their 1st session exams yeah no one has no one i do not know maybe some poor little both graduate students yeah working on their seasons 0 yeah so so when you were a kid what kind of games did you used to play is there one you remember well i think the 1st game i played on the htc phone i remember super it is time for a run 0 yeah right everyone please yes it is very popular there it is free you can call them on the phone so i remember yes yeah so i just see it on the phone and start playing it yeah every time i went to the apple store thank you that will play games on their phone yeah i remember the plants with zombies it is something that plants vs sound peas yeah it is something that everyone says once yeah i still have it on my computer now 0 right my mother played my mother can even more than me you know she finished all the stages aww some of my classmates in high school they even play when they are reading yeah they played in class 0 last year when i was in high school after the nl exams i played that game with my friends 0 bye it is classic i also watched some of the videos on bilibili  about those games and the modifications ones notifications yeah so it is like different versions of it like they also changed the game by themselves 0 so they can create some sub games i do not know by some creator implemented inside the game yeah i do not know how to say it that sounds cool i think the 1st time i played this game was in primary school when my uncle came to my grandpa is house ah he showed me how to play the game i do not remember when i 1st played this game i just think it is like pre installed on my ipad and i got my ipad like also in my also when i was in my primary school it is like 67 years old and 0 that is so sweet great one i think everyone loves it yeah also minecraft 0 my craft minecraft every time i went to my visit my friends yeah it is when you always play it together 0 it is very interesting yeah but i do not while i was playing it i do not have friends play with me and when some of my friends start playing it i just do not play it anymore so which kind of mode do you prefer order or the creative one i think the crazy one 0 bye everyone playing for me because i always get scared by those yeah lots of different scary creatures research yeah by using the creative mode you can build houses you can build different kinds of i am sorry thank you there are many videos on bilibili and youtube as well yeah yeah i have watched some to build houses yeah using those different kind of decorations 0 yeah i think i watched someone that used minecraft to build a computer i mean they built from from something like the from very simple circuit how do they even how is that even possible i do not know maybe they are just very familiar with the computer very familiar with some gates some computer gates you the basic logic behind it and they just it must be very hard and i think it is an undergraduate student and he published a paper based on it that is interesting and tricky yeah let me think about other games okay some small games for $3.99 i am pushing that you so it is a chinese website that has many small games i played a lot of similar games on it but it is difficult for me to describe any of them the fire boy and water girl 0 yeah we were at the bottom so you just use the keystrokes to control the fireboil watergiru and yeah i love playing together to accomplish some tasks i remember when i was 6 years old i live in my grandma is house and we okay together ah the 1st time i played this is when i visited my friend and she showed me the 4399 website i find this very interesting and the 1st thing we played together is the fire fire what fireboy and what the heck yeah yeah sometimes like in the computer class in primary school people you just playing games under the nose of teachers yes but our systems has the detection you know 0 kind of things you do will review on the aww that is sad yes you can only play games after we have done all the homework ah this after all you can play after you have done your work you can play   so you did you play a sport or have another hobby when you are young do i play a sword i learned dance from like the 1st year of primary school to you to the 4th or 5th year and then i never danced anymore because of the maybe because of the pressure 0 yeah yeah just studying and learning and preparing for exams and never think about the i will be there hobbies i do you have do you do you play sports or have any other hobby as a kid i think the 1st hobby for me is playing piano piano thank you

places then it is not worth the money yeah  pacha this limit when my parents strongly suggest me to go to the museum ah why to build up my body is strength 0 stay healthy yeah because we just stay at home every day yes you i think walking on the road is less effective than doing workout in the gym of course yeah but i prefer walking i prefer working out as well yes same i think workout in the gym is torture yes i have not been to the gym but i can imagine it i remember when i was in grade grade 11 or grade 10 yeah i went to the local gym near to my home huh and my mother bought the kind of course  which is one to one course  the teacher is very strict to me uhhh every time i went there 1st i will do one hour non oxygen work i love you too yeah i know i can get you and then for another half an hour running or climbing exercise yeah i got back home i was just lying on the bed and can not do nothing 0 yeah it sounds but it is really effective i can not after 2 weeks or a month you i cut out loose weights around 4 to 5 kilograms wow yeah that is truly effective and also my teacher forced me to eat less uhhh and every meal i should take a photo for her and send to her god it sounds scary yes you are you planning to go to other place no i mean not these days 0 i know we are delight no i do not have any plan yet do you want to go to birmingham i do not know i just want to reduce my spending i think the cost go to here is much less than london i know i know i get it but the trail the train the train still costs a lot 0 yes you maybe we should go to another place which is near edinburgh 0 yeah then we can go there by bus that is how the thank you as a little time consume me i know time consuming but it saves money money and time  i am actually though i think we can go to glasgow by bus you have been to glasgow yes but i it is about 6 months ago 6 months ago yeah i do want to visit there again do you find that is going interesting yes the university is very beautiful university yes and the last time i went there and the gallery is closed 0 so it is worth visiting again ah yeah you are right  you go to the black pool i am thinking about it but do not have such an interesting in the amusement park yeah i do not have such interesting interest in it yeah you so do you want to go to the park i am i am going to hug yes i really i am going to yes because my brother

like nature you can climb mountains you can just you can go to the visit go to the seaside i mean enjoy the scenery yeah i think my favorite thing about edinburgh is the people around here ah it is much safer than living in london or other places you mean that yes we can go out later at night and i feel you to work at to walk alone at night people here are friendly much friend friendly is there a particular food you used to eat as a child do you know how to make it do you still like eating it now i think it must be tomato fried eggs yeah yes i also like it i like every chinese singer right now i remember when i was in grade 8 huh in i think it is around the mid autumn festival huh and our teacher assigned us a homework that we should learn how to cook a dish by ourselves bye and we all must record a video you and every time before we go to lunch our teacher will randomly choose a video and on lower school you are all the classmates in and that works for a month ugh so i think the conversation is long enough now good so we should stop recording yeah i think so bye (EDACC-C16-00)

scoop these things into 3 red bags and we will meet her wednesday at the train station ok that is done there are some topics that we have here things you could discuss with your partner favorite hobbies favorite or least favorite games sports games music food now or when you were a child best trip or holiday things you like or dislike about scotland so looking at these topics which one would you like to go i think i will go with the 1st one when you were a kid what kinds of games do you use to play is there any one you remember well so i think i have i think i prefer the 1st one okay so should i go 1st yeah you go 1st yeah okay when i was a kid i think one of the games i really loved to play was the ps yes playstation playstation was that should be playstation 2 yeah yes i played that a lot i still recall and now i still play and my favorite game there is the yeah for me i think when i was a kid the one i remember very well was football yeah i played a lot of football when i was a kid you know coming back from school i would not want to do anything else all i wanted to do was to play football and then have some fun with my kid it is mentally football i usually played that time i can not really think of any game that then because i was so in love with the game i liked football before playing football before i came to scotland i was a kind of i always wanted to be a professional footballer yeah but things change now because growing up in a place where you do not get to there are 1000s of people playing football and only a few are getting are ending from it like it was really really yeah sure and same happened with me here because while we were growing up i think a lot of people wanted to be a professional footballer played for chelsea arsenal and all of that but as we grew things began to change in our lives and then we began to see ourselves in various places working for money and just they are not like the interest in football just disappeared like that okay so like apart from i am just watching football are you a fan of anything do you support anything no i do not support anything it is just what should work casually yeah just football i kill you i i love man utd i love to watch manchester united and i think they are the best team in the world so maybe since you do not have a team you are supporting you should just come and support manchester united i wish ah i wish will so you do not want to watch you know just suppose manchester united you should maybe one day we should just go watch not like i do not support my own no no like on the not like i do not want to support my youth yeah they are doing well yeah they are doing perfectly well but right now i do not think i have that time to you know what i am really scared about football is that you know when you go watch football and when you come back you have to face some bantams with your friends or yeah with your your opponents maybe people yeah people that are not your like when you played and like they are not team they are not the man you and want him late like that and then i had to come back to the house i did not watch the ball i i understand i perfectly understand isha you why do you play football games too i am such a boring person all i do is work for money i do work from morning till i work double shift sometimes because i have to cover for my educational abuse too so you are not the only person working but i just try to make time out for every other thing yeah i do not really see myself playing video games you watch movies yeah sometimes i do sometimes i do but not regularly maybe when i am just hanging out with friends we go see a movie eat popcorn and then we come back to the house but sitting down a lot to watch a movie i think i find it very difficult for me unless i go out with friends then that is when i can watch a movie okay i will buy you i watch a lot of movies and i prefer most times i like when i am watching series yeah because i like the suspense that comes with it so i watch a lot of series my favorite series are peaky blinders have you seen peaky blinders can you hear me yeah i can hear you okay i was saying have you seen peaky blinders peaky blinders is a very nice series it is a movie that you would like to watch and you will like it yeah i hope peaky blender will have heard a lot about the movie i think it will be an interesting movie but i will just have to see it one day i hope so and also i love game of thrones too i think that was my favorite until i actually watched peaky blinders okay that is great i think i have seen game of thrones not all the episodes you know and not all the seasons because there was a time they stopped and i think that was when i stopped watching game of thrones that was almost the last episode they had to delay the last season or episode yeah that is when i stopped watching okay i think i watched the last episode where one of the dragons died and it was actually very i felt very should i say sad about it and things like that but you know movies there are things that you should try and just understand that it is a movie it is never going to end the way you want it to yeah sure yeah she did a better job thank you i do not think there is anything else we are supposed to talk about it is 15 minutes we started this meeting and i think it is 15 minutes now right okay yeah yeah yeah sure okay so i think i should end it here now have a nice time bro thank you for having me so i will just stop the recording now (EDACC-C18-00)
ooh exciting okay so i am a participant we are supposed to say which participants we are i am participant c 26 p one you are c 26 p 2 so just say that i think hi my participant number is c 26 p 2 26 p 2 nice okay okay so for c 26 p one it is please call stella ask her to bring these things with her from the store 6 spoons of fresh snow peas 56 slabs of blue cheese and maybe a snack for her brother bob we also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids she can scoop these things into 3 red bags and we will go meet her wednesday at the train station your go okay cool heh yeah pussy yeah but funny cool so now i guess we just talk for like 15 minutes about whatever we want they have like basic topics but i think they just want them to be like vaguely general so it can be about food if you want i think you will tend to talk about personal things not food all right i can try we have to have like a sign like yeah definitely we can just do the like no no what ymca was because of my you know the entire covid thing so my brain is or maybe because i love it in islands or people i love my brain moves super slow it will be fine okay well i mean one of the things is they said do not do anything like super specific as locations but then one of their suggested topics is what do you like or dislike about edinburgh scotland and you visited me here it was a long ass time ago okay what do you miss from when you visited me here are you already recording  okay hey i miss there is the market we went to the weekend market yeah where you found the food that you do not see here in japan like rabbit yeah in exploring those food in each stand that was cool yeah yeah of course the game stopped me of course yeah the game style is amazing with all of the like in food and stuff maybe should i when i send you some whiskey should i send you some food as well that will go back but would i be able to cheese was good and the honey was good everything was so good yeah just whiskey is fine because i got the best of them no i should not say the japanese word no you can say that well i think code switching is fine they will deal with it okay okay yeah nice yeah it is so funny to not okay so yeah i do not know so you are going back home to mi kko to the island soon yeah tomorrow morning what have you been in tokyo for a one what what yeah what just general worker i returned to office started this month and i am supposed to show up at the office once a week and so my plan is to fly to tokyo on thursday night go to office on friday spend weekend in tokyo and i have a team meeting on tuesday so i go to monday tuesday office and fly back to miyako and following thursday i you so that is what i am doing but the flights are getting expensive  so i do not know how long i can do this yeah that is a lot so far because there are not many good restaurants in miyako so it is a good opportunity for you yeah like i made the list like i am going to eat here and i find out i think the hotel depends on what i want to eat yeah that makes sense last weekend i spent in roppongi you yeah it reminded me of you know that bike parking i was going to be like because of all of the useless foreigners or no there are not many foreigners in roppongi anymore what what happened chinese and that too and maybe the entire covid and work from home yeah surprising yeah because it was like mori tower was like all the banks and like maybe because i spend on the weekend so probably that is why  yeah yeah yeah no i am saying in the today because one i want to shop at the pachica before i leave for miyako and my mom is going to a trip tomorrow  and i am going to meet up with my mom in tokyo station which is walking distance from here i am staying in ginza cool on  yeah

looking forward to it and i am really looking forward to going to is my dad is and seeing like his garden in the summer and like his lemon tree bye this apricot tree and like it will be nice it will be nice to be back yeah back in california for a week  so are you going to graduate this summer no i got i was originally supposed to be done at the end of the year and i got a 3 month extension for covert so i will probably be done in like march thank you yeah well because you know we discussed maybe you will not be there for that long yeah was one of the option when you are choosing what to do so wow yeah about to make it yeah yeah yeah but yeah but i am thanks yeah i will need it i mean i still have to write my whole thesis so there you go but but so you will be busy i will be busy but it will be but i think it has been going pretty well yeah yeah that is actually what i am in london for i am in london for like working doing some like research down there and i have to be down there for 2 thank you for 2 months so obviously if i am not in london and you visit london thank you yeah 2 months if i if i am not in london and you visit london you have to come to edinburgh to see me required hey but if i am in london you can crash with me in london and market hunting yeah yeah of course bye have you been to borough market in london yes 0 yeah yeah yeah yeah i love the what is it the bread with cheese like focaccia or 0 just a cheese sandwich you maybe no no the toast 2 guys took that at the camp yeah yeah yeah grilled cheese like grilled cheese sandwiches bring on a cheese sandwich yeah yeah so good i could eat it every day i regretted i visited the market like very late of my stay so i could not revisit  like that following day was sunday there were clothes or something and i hated myself 0 i miss food  because i have been having stuff nose i could not taste much and the taste came back so i am so everything tastes so good so i have been thinking about food okay i am glad it came back when did it come back yeah this last weekend good yeah poof i was like how long is it going to take and i tried many food nothing tastes good as good as it used to be i can taste but it is not like a 100% but now i have like fish very japanese gentle food and still tastes so good so i am like 0 the taste is back so i am so happy i am glad you yeah it sounded like i was like of all the people like who i was like no like when you got when you send your photo of the cocktail being like it looks so beautiful and i have no idea what it tastes like it is really soft it is gin tonic and there must be some fine taste right because it is a famous bar called star bar in ginza you yeah but i could not taste 0 i think i may have even been there once i have definitely heard of it yeah they are famous or popular or something the bartender said their bar was on a tv show one time you so now i am back eat drink this you got that yeah yeah yeah so let us see we have like one more minute according to my clock okay i did not even check but like i said because i live in the island my brain is moving so slow i am serious just because you spend all of your effort windsurfing i know because we do not really have a difficult conversation you you know we talked about weather food but not like politics or anything you you know very less no stress at all you so i think my brain is not trying to work fast not much pressure so i was when i was talking with you you were like you were like and i have to read the sentence again and again to comprehend well that is just because maybe if you have not been speaking english at all lately yeah i would be much worse if we were having this conversation in japanese by the way from tomorrow we will accept tourists eww but it has to be from like a group tour you know by no typical japanese they let thing happen and see what other talks about it and no one really complain then boom  yeah plus tosk who was going to start a bicycle ramen touring company or something so maybe i can make him he is not actually going to do it but i am more like i could be like can you make an excuse or something hehehehe i will be like yeah yeah totally my friends ramen touring company it is the boy yeah i mean he is still he is still working doing his normal job but right but some of my co workers started their own business jolly and covid you and some are leaving our company to focus on their business you one guy said it is about sdg environmental stuff you yeah so so that also makes me feel like what i have been doing you know some people are starting their own job but i am just chilling in toa piko island windsurfing drinking whiskey sounds like fun life yeah yeah i was going to be like i was like 0 maybe not that bad yeah yeah here definitely and like starting a like environmental company from from an island kind of makes sense  some ways depends on what it is doing bye you yeah i have no idea but yeah the windsurfing has been fun i started to sail faster now it makes me so scared hahaha when i go i am like i am scared but the fun i feel improvement every day i can not wait to do it with you have you done it once on on because it is lake in scotland frustrating to get better you you know you can not just get on and done it takes time because you have to move kind of opposite of what you do on the land you so yeah so you can not really enjoy the day you start it really sucks i enjoyed it the day i started it good me too no you know like i want you to go yeah for sure i mean i definitely enjoy something if it is mostly me like falling over and going sploosh and getting back up again yeah water is so clear so even you fall you do not feel like icky or anything like it is actually funny using lots of fish so sounds so beautiful looking forward to see you in morocco great ok i am going to stop the recording okay (EDACC-C14-00)
hi my participant number is c 15 p one i am just going to read the paragraph hi my participant number is c 15 p 2 and it is my turn to read the paragraph yeah okay so what are we talking about yeah so the topic that we chose was basically what was the 1st movie that we watched that was based on a book so for me it is alice in wonderland what is it for you for me i think it is harry potter the 1st one yeah the 1st one i mean i remember reading philosopher is stone and then i watched the movie like my sister told me that there are movies on these books and and then i watched it and then it was music the 1st one was a really nice one what was your favorite have you seen all the 7 harry potter movies yes yes yes i am pure blood sorry what is what is your favorite one out of all of those i think the 1st one because the 1st one was like the exact like the most appropriate representation of what i had thought bye what i had imagined from the book you so the 1st one was the most appropriate one for me and this yeah and it was also like i do not know it was nice and good like like very similar to what she wrote at least like jk rowling yeah yeah exactly that makes sense what about you how did you feel after watching alice alice in wonderland was animation movie of course so it was interesting of course but i obviously preferred the books i actually preferred the sequel to alice in wonderland through the looking glass much more than 0 yes i remember that poem jabberwocky it was brilliant in the slightly tones yeah and then give it the wave we should know i forgot this is a nonsense poem yeah because it is so exciting hunger games i watched one of the games i was the 1st movie that is that is have you read hunger games yeah i have read hunger games of course i have read hunger games bye the hunger games honestly i feel okay this is going to be a spoiler filled conversation i feel but the ending of hunger games do you remember it or not yeah i have read it yeah right so it is so realistic right yeah that is exactly what happens and that is why i hate it so much my favorite part of hunger games was katniss the dresses that she wore alright see ya yeah conditions so every time like and the representation of it in movies also was so amazing like every time she would open some dress and she turned into mokinji or something yeah that is true i mean i think that is the 2 dresses right the 1st is one where she is on fire because like she has got yeah and then the other one is the one where she turns into the mockingjay right yeah and there is another one when they are called again for the games  when all that when when they say that she is pregnant she comes as a bride 0 i have not seen that part so i do not remember 0 so there is this like her dresses always for me i do not know her dress dress speaks way more than anything else that is happening there thank you like it is a story of its own fair enough i mean that is what they wanted to show in the books also right like that yeah plotline with sinha that he used the like he used fashion to bring up and it is actually interesting to think about considering like throughout at least the 1st book they really keep describing the capital is fashion and how outrageous it is exactly exactly sinha using it to you know create to like display katniss is personality is such a like it is so so like he literally just turns it on its head turns the trope on its head like the outrageous fashion and it is like suddenly it becomes a what do you call it like like a symbol exactly it becomes a symbol and like expression because you bye can you say anything against the capital out loud you you can not stand against the capital and and so like this is very subtly rebelling against the capital you which was extremely amazing that is true actually like i feel like for i mean it was pretty brilliant how if you look at it for for like the people of the capital that was just another kind of outrageous fashion for at least yeah people they were like 0 wow look at this new designer like new york fashion type feelings yeah but for the people in power like president snow and all these people yeah yeah yeah he knew what it meant and this is also why they basically killed sinha yeah which is either give the 9 i like like even the reporter who used to like host the whole event f e f e triggered 0 yeah i do not remember his name pernil so even the host was very i do not know how to say like she knew what questions to ask too questions to us and how to get information  whenever katniss used to show up and she used to wear some dress and something  she used to call her out to that she used to point she used to bring attention to that yeah this is the message every trinkets character to be honest i liked hunger games a lot thank you good book and movie yeah like was one of the dystopian books done right even though yeah the thing is again back to the ending it was the perfect ending it was a brilliant ending yeah it was just that it was so goddamn realistic that i did not like it okay do you 0 go ahead no i was just saying this is the problem like you usually fall into like these kind of books to you know cure the hero comes out on top at the end of the yeah yeah yeah they win everything and they live happily ever after in bullshit and then this this like woman just comes in and just literally pulls the rug out from under our feet going 0 by the way the real like this is like i do not want to know were you team pita or team gale the love interest yeah yeah gay life same like i i completely understand the whole what do you call it you in the last book the whole thing with like which one will you choose and i yeah the reasoning is solid man honestly like seriously i do not like katniss does not need someone who adds fire to her fire she already has all of that yeah taking time off exactly i mean the concept of yin yang opposites attract yeah someone who can tom yeah peter is like the water to her fire she does not need oil to be added to her flames yeah by the way teams remind me like which team were you on twilight why why would you bring that up no i do not know i love that absolutely absolutely none of them no edward or team jacob neither we got it no i please that was team taylor nortner 0 my god taylor lord that is horrifying i do not want to talk about twilight it has been bye it has been more than 15 years now thank you anyway what how did we even end up 0 yeah because of the tips let us move on to like  what else thinking back to harry potter you said you liked the 1st movie i would actually say i liked the 3rd one the best 0 a lot of people choose a particular yeah thank you everyone yeah i feel like that was the more like the closest to like i mean the 1st one was obviously very close but i feel like the 3rd one captured the what is it called the aura the environment bye the i do not know just it really captured the essence of the thank you cook really well that is probably just because i found so quorum but yeah was that guy is brilliant but in general that was the one that i really liked and then i do not know and it just went downhill no i really liked the 5th one the 5th one was really nice because i really like luna lovegood she is one of my favorites and we will see you next time got it those and and 5th was the one like it was also one of the saddest books but also the happiest because everybody was there like there was remus there was sirius there was luna for fred  george everyone like the whole order of phoenix yeah it was like the one happy moment before everything went to shit exactly i can not look for the storm that makes sense i can actually in i enjoyed the 5th one that much to be honest i do not know why though i think it was just because by that time i had stopped really liking the actors also ah maybe thank you i feel yeah i did not like prisoners of azkaban really i do not know like chamber of secrets is my most hated one yeah i do not like to have secrets and then and then prisoners ask me 0 also love you also what mobile to file yeah goblet of fire so i was so annoyed at the fact that they goblet of fire was probably one of my favorite books out of the series same same what i was going to say yeah i think it was because of the whole drivers of tournament the challenges exactly and the new schools and new yeah yeah i think that there are other yeah magic schools yeah exactly like all of that and then what is it called and then the fact that they just removed everything from the maze like i love the whole maze 0 yeah of the triwizard tournament and you moved all the cool things like the sphinx and everything from the maze and they just you this weird i do not know american deep south body horror yeah also like the whole meme about harry did you put your name in the goblet of fire 0 my god dumbledore asked calmly exactly double door as family like it flies across the room shakes and is like did you relax another thing that i will thank you so much forgive these and we will see you next time movies is that they put the whole blame on shou chang for like yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah was not it yeah one the maria yeah it was torture something something something yes you but obviously they do not show half of the characters and so yeah also they had to together get rid of cho chang so that ginny could come in as the love itself exactly and the book genie is so cool man exactly so cool but in movies they have just shown her as some idiot you down for things yeah i do not like movie genie at all the book genius it is a watered down version of the book jimmy i said you it was amazing yeah she was good at quidditch you she knew how to tackle all her 7 brothers yeah right like she was good at bat bogey hexes exactly she would go to good at excel yeah i do not know like after i mean like now i am talking about harry potter like this but generally after this whole debacle with like jk rowling i just  same sense of connection with harry potter anymore i do not know because they for me yes as a person maybe take it on me  is bad or whatever but books are different through the the death of the author is the birth very very bad but okay i mean books are completely different they have got nothing to do with with other than the fact that he wrote it  it is separate from her fair enough but yeah i mean i do not think i have the capacity to completely differentiate the art from the artist so 0 lose interest in things like in art when the art is thank you person so that and also because of course like my favorite what do you call it my favorite work has always been lord of the rings so  like you really want what was the 1st series you have read the 1st series i have read a lot actually but maybe narnia i think chronicles of narnia probably it was a fast i am not sure like that was the one that i remember because i read cs lewis when i was really young like i was 9 exactly or so i think yeah i am sure i would have probably read other stuff before like i read a lot of you know famous 5 secret 7 0 yes and all that nancy drew nancy drew hardy boys but will i really i hate valley series 0 you remember the school series mallory tower saint clair 0 yes yes yes yes yes yes yeah bye yeah i feel like if i if you want to call it a like series if you want to know that i would say that those were the ones that i read 6th form mine was erragone ah fire drag yeah yeah yeah i am excited i read that actually you know like surprisingly i read eragon really late like when i was even percy jackson for example like these are the books that thank you did not like your preteens right but yeah then i had never like nobody had ever given these to me when i was at that age yes and so i ended up reading them at like 17 18 and i did not like them at all you specifically because it was very similar to lord i mean pauline christopher pauline himself said that he yeah the inspiration from the lord of the rings yeah and so because i had read a lot of the rings 1st then eragon just seemed like this watered down copy and i was like okay enjoy that that much  same with percy jackson like i think just because i had crossed the age for exactly i did not enjoy it was not it the same for you no i read i started with it a long and i read it in when i was in 5th standard  and then i started harry potter then hunger games then the divergent series then twilight 0 it was a back to back thing yeah actually pretty much same like when these ones were anyway coming out when we were like 15 16 yes when i did harry potter i was 11 like i started harry potter when i was 11 thank you and then by the time you finished their play yeah because it was difficult to arrange books at that time i could not find all the books at once thanks so like i had to give gas even though i did not really want to 0 way because it was difficult to find books and then you but yeah so harry potter which is why i was a hardcore potterhead because you i read it around the same age bye when it was written and so i was all like you know how was the the good thing with me was that we had all the like my mother used to handle the books in the school library right 0 and stuff so i could just like put in video is the book i want to read just so i read through all the 7 books like i started at like when i was 10 i think  and then the last like book 7 came when i was in class 7 that is when i was 13 you so i read book 7 then only thank you once i read that i moved on to of course the other series like hunger games and yeah you had divergent these are all the apocalypse yeah yeah out at that point of time yeah so funny thinking you huh good there were these phases for me like 1st there was this apocalypse and dystopian future and stuff that is then there were like books based on cancer and you trauma ptsd i agree i had like a kite runner 1000s of friends faulted 0 yeah back to back i have not read as you because you know that right you have not read fulton house i tried okay i tried like okay so basically the thing what happened was okay i will not say i have not read it but basically what happened was i was in what 9 and i do not know ninth i think and all these people were you know after maybe 11th i do not even know but i was yeah 11th because i remember i had like exams or something because of which i was not feeling and i had it in 9th year yeah so maybe okay anyway so if i was an 11th i would have been like 16 or 17 and these people were like you read it read it you will cry so much you will cry so much and i kept waiting for the time where i would cry and i was like i the book ended and i was like where am i supposed to cry team i do not know it was too i have no idea too cheesy for me the book and even the movie was too no i mean i do not know if that is fake for some reason you it just felt fake as if someone is trying too hard to make you emotional about it it is like it was basically like nicholas park is on like crack 0 yes i think you should also like one stop chatting in like 0 yes it is because we only talk 40 minutes about it  anyway go ahead finish with your thought yeah i was saying that a book that actually did make me cry a lot was yes i love you wow i was a kid okay i was in 5th standard when i read it why would you do that to yourself but okay i do not know i reserve judgment on this then because you worry okay okay thank you bye bye bye (EDACC-C09-00)
okay so i think we are recording my participant number is c 25 p one perfect okay my participant is number is c 25 p 2 please call stella ask her to bring these things with her from the store 6 spoons of fresh snow peas 5 thick slabs of blue cheese and maybe a snake for her brother bob we also need a small plastic spoon okay nice i will start the time for a conversation i think we will be talking about formula one right well surprise did not you thanks for having me no neither did i but we went towards the i mean the race was better than i expected actually like it was going to be so boring because it is spain always but honestly well it probably was not the best so far of the season but it was not like boring like i was not bored no no actually it is things so and it was also nice to add some more time changes than normally normally it is just thank you for your question one tire change and then nothing really happens and the whole middle sector is pretty boring and then in the end you know that actually will be it ends as you want to do with things things happened yeah that was good leclara i was very happy for a 2nd so my dutch guy could win was it hamilton or leclerc leclerc was in 1st and then he what happened again with him i think something with the power unit i watched the replay it seemed that the gearbox or something just started no no sorry the turbo the turbo yes you had the turbo 0 could hear the wind spinning and then all of a sudden like it cut out and you could feel like metal like whistling or like whining it was like ah down poor guy that guy does not have luck with engines because also bahrain in 2019 right he was leading and then his engine i am done was leading in monaco last year or he was going to you hold position and then his engine poof well no like last year he put himself so he got poor position then max was trying to get was actually putting in a fast lap and then leclerc got put himself in the wall started 1st because the session was ended and yeah then with hitting the wall and his tires he fucked up his gearbox i think yeah no well that is that is true but it was purely accidental i mean i do not remember you rosberg did the same thing and michael schumacher actually did the same thing very famously so i think schumacher was 1st in monaco where he like into the very you know the final court like the 2nd to final corner redcast yeah i am he also was like michael like it was in the night or early 2000s he was pole position it was the final lap like everyone is doing their final lap and he like just did not even bother turning it in like he just understeered into the wall but like you could see he was not even trying to do a lock and then in 2014 or 15 i think nico rosberg he like outbraked himself into the into the breaking zone right before the hairpin and he like went you know yeah no good for the claire i actually have hopes from this weekend i think he can put himself in 1st place again and then hopefully finish the race this time i do not think ferrari is suited i mean cause i have been hearing that mercedes is really well for slow corners mercedes is apparently one of the best teams and last on the spain they fixed their whole porpoising issues and hamilton was the fastest car on track like consistently so i did not like mercedes i think i have diagnosed myself i just support the underdog like i supported ferrari bye their entire shit phase where it was just an abomination and they still are because ferrari will always find a way to fuck i do not know if we can swear we will always find a way to mess up but yeah no i am hoping russell i think russell i am going to say thank you russell is going to outqualify and win if not max i do not think checo has got it no i do not think carlos has got it if carlos crashes out again honestly he is going to get sacked they just signed a contract extension with him yeah yeah but no well we will see but no i also i just also really do not like hamilton so i think if russell wins i will be happy as well and also bye but i think it also would be nice since last year max he won the championship but i have to agree no not really so i think it would be nice if he actually won fair and real this year and then afterwards i will be happy with any other guy to win the championship except for hamilton i do not like still do not like him no i do not want him i definitely do not want hamilton to beat schumacher is record i mean he already has most races and pole positions but i do not want him to have more world championships of and michael also i just realized we are matching kind of shirts almost good stuff and even your flag is matching the whole thing and for my scottish vibes everything in blue and white that you buy in scotland yeah i thought my walls here are very very empty there is nothing on it yeah at some point i thought okay if i hang a flag there is a large space with my wall is covered that should be fine that is so true my grandfather also sent me a picture because he also thought it was too empty so i now got my sister i have actually that is from the park right near waverly right and i have actually never been in that i think that is where the festival was that you guys wanted to go did you get the ticket for the fly open air no because it was they were not the things that they sold today because tutku wanted to buy tickets  i i do not even wish i would mentioned names no one of my friends wanted to buy tickets i realize but so they started sending tickets at 100 clock in the morning and they will only add a half an hour later it was all sold out already no what so i mean i know i think open air was the thing that our other friend went to yeah i know i know i know but it was during the exams for you for the energy and large scale 0 weekend so we went there yesterday it is called princess gardens it is a pretty nice and it is less windy we were drinking right yeah 0 is it less windy yeah because it is in between sort of 2 hills yeah the meadows it was extremely windy and i did not really like it and then i said to our friend friend so then we went to the prince is gardens because it is more sheltered and there are more trees and there are less wind and it was actually it was really nice and we could still sit in the sun it is a gradient enjoy it i actually do not know if because i think meadow is like no one is going to catch you but i do not think you are allowed to drink in public so this is where they are the only 2 drinking there like where you guys the only one was drinking there was everyone else there i do not know if you get a fine for it i also do not know you but i did not know but now i know but now good so i do not know during the fringe you can drink outdoors 0 but i do not know around i know else is column like dundee or glass like you will police finds it enjoyable to hand out fines for like an activity for them like this guy this guy yeah well yeah i have it i have to behave myself i do not want to get i need to 3 more months of behaving myself here i do not want to get into trouble no so close to finishing my degree so i will look out a bit but i think every time you cycle past the meadows there are always yeah sitting there and i mean there would not be enough police people to contain everyone there well so ah well should be fine you but yeah but yeah i am thinking what i did not actually realize that george became 3rd yeah yeah he went he went on the he he that is the 2nd podium right yeah i also look so apparently this is this was the 6th race spain i believe and he has not finished below 5th all of this time seriously yeah let us go russell every single one of his races literally he was top 5 or better and obviously i do not think now mercedes would definitely be the 3rd strongest car especially with their upgrades from spain but still it means that russell was only out raced by either a ferrari or a red bull i am actually not sure if anyone else impressive yeah i am also by the way looking at the practice times in 1st practice he put in the 4th fastest time 2nd practice he put in the 2nd fastest time 3rd practice he put in the 3rd fastest time he actually did quite well only then he 0 he was actually 4th after qualifying yeah i did not realize that he was doing so well yeah he is so consistent like ah i think hamilton is going to retire quickly before people start comparing them too much because or move teams but so apparently like hamilton was always like 0 ferrari you know is it is a dream i would want to finish my career with ferrari but ferrari now signed leclerc for i think another 3 or 4 years and science for also at least until the end of 2026 so 0 like hamilton is not but science like there is a budget cap cause i was reading this like you know helmut marco right the guy not the christian horner guy for red bull but this other old austrian dude does like drive yeah yeah yeah like trash talking to the media basically on ferrari saying like 0 i do not think we are spending more than ferrari we are definitely within the budget cap and you know science crashing 3 or 4 times out of the last 3 years that can be cheap to repair you know like you know while we are developing the car and making upgrades you know ferrari is spending money on fixing science is crashed car which honestly some of the accidents were pretty big but on the other hand i am not sure the 1st 2 or 3 races and jacko and verstappen both from red bull their engines stopped because it was too hot yeah yeah yeah do not be cheap either it is true yeah i mean ferrari got a one.2 that day i am checking it out yes they got a one.2 that was a ferrari one.2 on the opening race of the season that is kind of cool yeah so yeah i am not sure how they fixed that stuff but i also remember on the 1st race it was all red bull engines also the alphatauri engines who broke down yeah it was just one so i am looking now at the results so i think actually norris was on the podium once as well this season lando yeah in the imola 0 i am on which was was that a red 0 yeah that was the race where they did not want to turn on drs for like half the lap 0 my 0 yeah the most boring race of this i think of the season yeah no there was not really nothing happening there that was terrible yep miami was miami interesting it was quite good i mean it was not terrible like you enjoyed to there were some overtakes spain was good it has been it was a decent race that was really good yeah how was australia was australia any good i am trying to remember yeah it was the one in the middle of the night so i did not watch it 0 yeah 0 yeah yeah yeah because i did not yeah well i watched it but i swear there is nothing that happens nice i mean russell podium which is nice nice lewis and forth look at that ah nice nice nice outperformed by now by rookie i feel bad at least now it has been like 3 to 4 seasons it must have been at least 3 seasons in a williams you but okay let us see the standings i am curious of the overall standing i see how long we have been talking for by the way 0 wow we are actually almost at 13 minutes good good good okay so who is going to win the championship after the 1st 6 races now that knowing what you know who is going to win yeah i think wait i need to find the overall drivers this thing 1st the overall drivers thanks dan to make a good informed decision us can not but this is just all okay wait standings season 2021 can you too 2022 sorry yeah why can not i see everything in just spain i love us like i am going to send it to you 0 and google asks it for me right i think if i just google it then we will have it as well the your job standing i got it i will kind of miss the it is max in front yeah 6 points phew let us go to netherlands but i think to be honest i think ferrari should win this no but if they continue doing it like going like this then max will take it and i still i still want to say i hope maxwell will actually win where he deserves to win instead of what happened last year yeah and i think there is a lot of there is a good chance that actually will happen so i am rooting for a visible and rooting for what i am hoping for no okay it is matt okay okay so he is now leading honestly ferrari being ferrari i just they got lucky with the you know the development phase but i do not think they have the resources and the and the like the the brains in the team to actually like keep developing the car and make smart upgrades like i have just been so pessimistic of ferrari like they ruined fernando alonso is career they ruined vettel is career they are going to ruin charlotte clare is and sergio perez is career it is just what they do yeah i do not know i am going to say verstappen is going to win it i think quite easily but for the teams i think red bull might but it is going to be close with mercedes i think ferrari is going to drop 3rd yeah i think i think that will shoot wind that as well but so i also would be happy with mercedes yeah being 2nd but no and i think i also somewhat like the classic ferrari car the red one the beautiful horse so i think it is always nice to see them perform well and i hope they win the constructors and then max can have the i will be there for the that is what i hope it is not what i think i think red bull will win the constructors mercedes will be 2nd ferrari will be 3rd and then max will win jekyll will not be in the top 3 i think i do not think jacko will be at all russell leclerc and max will outclip him but who knows well ok i think wait let me just check that we have been talking for long enough yeah 17 minutes with i think the gaps we had in the conversation they can cut out the names of our friends yes we still have enough time and it should all be good i am stopping the recording okay go ahead are you sure you want to stop recording 0 why am i recording to the cloud 0 no okay yes (EDACC-C13-00)
hi my participant number is c 20 p one and i am going to read out the passage hi my participant number is c 20 p 2 and i am going to read the passage please call stella ask her to bring these things with her from the store 6 spoons of fresh snow peas 5 thick slabs of blue cheese and maybe a snack for her brother bob we also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids so you can scoop these things into 3 red bags and we will go meet her wednesday at the train station all right so let us talk about food you food is a good topic is not it my favorite what was your favorite food growing up 0 my goodness well it is kind of difficult to answer because what was my brother is dietary restrictions there was a sick front period where i had spaghetti every day for dinner and not by choice so much i guess very traumatic despite this one of my favorite foods was still spaghetti with tomato sauce and cheese we speak to the people prevailing nature of pasta apart from that it is kind of hard to remember i really liked hummus which i feel like is quite sophisticated bye i really really yeah it just went on its own and stuff on bread and things that was very very nice and i liked i like calling the cast for the cake as well because it had very have a great day had bits that were like a pure chocolate like a chocolate bar instead of like a cakey mix okay so that is more enjoying the chocolate of it than the actual cake yeah the only other thing was fairy bread have you heard of it no okay so it is an australian thing and it is made from white bread with a layer of margarine or butter and then sprinkles on top okay it tastes really really good and normally when i tell people that they say it is disgusting but i loved it as a kid yeah okay fair enough i mean i like i love sprinkles and i love white bread so yes i can absolutely see that can understand it and you need the bottle to stick as sprinkles like that is how it works obviously i mean what did you like as a kid 0 i think something like well i mean pizza obviously and all kinds of white bread or white bread rolls or something like that i love them so bread rolls fresh or yeah sort of from the bakery  or pudding i really like pudding sort of pudding more like okay right more more probably like a custard thing 0 i loved custard yes so because that made from sort of packet sort of sachet that you would then stir into milk and yeah that was really good or yeah i was not a huge vegetable fan any kind of car it is surprising considering how you are like now yeah it has changed a bit but yeah not terribly into cheese like sort of very plain very simple cheeses but no cheese with too complex flavors could absolutely not stand courgettes yes or aubergines hated them and yeah sort of did you eat any like weird foods as a kid  that you would not eat now that is or maybe you would eat it now i do not know i mean i used to really like i guess here it is similar to black pudding sort of sausage which is made with parts i think pig blood so we will see you next time and so that is so yeah probably similar to black pudding quite like that which seems probably quite strange what i also really liked was pumpkin that was sort of pumpkin in jars so you would you would sweet sour pumpkin that you would sort of boil and and then put into jars and i really liked that as well because it was sort of sweet sound like a did you like pickle it or is it preserved thank you guys yeah yeah okay pickles sort of pickled exactly and i was able to eat rice just like plain white rice preferably basmati rice just yes just like that yeah and terribly bored of salads my parents loved salads so i did not like salads obviously and got really annoyed with plum jam at some point because we had loads and loads of plums and we had way too much jam and yeah yeah but yeah that has all changed no yours of us now how have your food habits changed and why have they changed i mean growing up with 2 brothers i just learned that you should eat everything presented to you and you should eat whatever the others do not eat as well because if that was the thing if my brothers did not finish a plate my dad and i would finish it so there was no food waste and if i put i think i have told you if anything goes in the fridge i just expect it to be gone next time  we had like enough food in the house it is just that everybody was grabbing at it so i have always developed the thing of older that if you as an older like if you have extra rice in the pan it is a challenge to finish the rice you have committed to the rice you have to finish the rice so i guess i see meals as a bit of a challenge but also just food is fantastic i love it there are very few foods i did not like as a kid and there are very few foods i do not like now like almost everything i eat now i also ate as a kid you and i think like brown brown seedy bread i did not i did not like seedy bread as a kid at all i hated the taste of sunflower seeds because i ate them too much we had some flowers we took the seed and then i just like i just overdid it but apart from that basically the same thing i did eat a lot of ketchup on toast when i was at a babysitter is and i am probably would not eat that now i am not going to lie to you thinly spread it was not too unhealthy but i would not i think i would give that one a pass but apart from that i do not think i have really changed i eat more vegetables now that is the only thing my parents blessed them that they were very good cooks in many ways but they were not good at just preparing plain vegetables because they were because they would do the thing the british thing of boiling them and now a bit older i know to steam them and then like very lightly season them and they taste much better well that is certainly a step forward yeah you live and you learn do not you yeah yeah i think like growing up it was also a thing for me i mean i am an only child and still it was a thing of sort of finishing food and it being regarded as being good if you finished food it is not fun to do with the older generation like quite yeah that is that is possible like i i do not know it definitely came from my parents and also sort of everyone around around me being like 0 yes we will well or it is it was it was not necessarily enforced that you would finish your food but you it was suggested or also like when we would go to a restaurant or something like that you would try to eat up everything and i think that is actually not a good idea no i think it is good to know your limits instead exactly exactly sort of because for example say pasta i can eat a lot of pasta very quickly and then i feel very very full afterwards because i have overeaten because i do not register quickly enough how much i have eaten you and so yeah i think that is actually not a really good idea yeah but otherwise i think like in terms of what i now eat is i think i am a bit more tolerant towards cheeses and i think that is also a known thing that children do not or that for example some bitter flavors are perceived i have heard that as well that their taste systems are heightened and so when they prefer bland food they literally are tasting in a different way to you they are not just uninventive it just is stronger for them yeah yeah exactly and so i think that has changed a bit but when when i am alone i basically do not eat cheese and also yeah yeah i try to eat far more vegetables and i cook a lot as opposed to eating a lot of bread when i am at home and i think that has more to do with sort of trying to eat as healthily as possible and also sort of being a bit more aware of what the actual calorie components you and i always liked fish and yeah 0 going home it will be nice to have some fish again because when i am alone i usually do not prepare fish because it is kind of a hassle and it and it makes more sense i think to prepare fish when you are actually with some other people and then you can sort of do it all in a sort of almost in bulk and and then all the tidying up and so on will i mean it is the same amount of tidying up and cleaning and taking out the rubbish immediately if you are eating it together or if you are doing it alone and so it is more worth it to do it alone to do it with other people i feel like you know i feel as students go we are both better cooks and a lot of students particularly like when we in the 1st the like 1st 2nd 3rd years i think when you get into the later years of a degree people generally have learned how to cook by then bye but i still feel it is frustrating when you know the idea of student cooking a lot of it is because i just do not have time to prepare big meals because if it is just me i am kind of okay to cook for just me but if i am you know and i do not mind if it is like simple food or repetitive food but if i am cooking for somebody else or my family i am then a much better cook than i normally am so it is not that i can not cook it is just that you know you do not want to be putting in all that effort when it is just for you yourself yeah you know that you are going to have to prove yourself also i know some people do bulk cooking and then just eat it for a couple of days but i am always a bit 1st of all if i have this food sitting in the fridge i feel really bad about it and i feel like i have to finish it and i also feel like i have to finish it within 2 days or something because i think otherwise it will go bad and it sort of puts pressure on me i i will then definitely have to eat it because i do not want to chop it but i do not know i am not a good bulk cook maybe it is better if you have more freezer space and you can actually store it for a bit longer that would be nice yeah i hate reheating food from the freezer though it takes forever i just i have it in the fridge because like i am dead paranoid about stuff going off but i figure that if it is only vegetables it can be in the fridge for 3 or maybe like 3.54 days and it will be okay like if it is vegetable soup and it is actually container that is all right and then i can just i do not have to worry about it i can just heat it up yeah yeah definitely also i mean yeah going to uni the heating up thing is also a problem yeah that is it is just so hard to like travel with it because the library does not do you know yeah have microwaves i see why they do not have microwaves but then the study room in the english block have a microwave and that is very useful because you can just go you know heat your little thing up true true true how do you feel your food habits will change when you graduate i am a partner do something else or something differently what i am going to cook for my family when i get home and it is useful now that one of my brothers has moved out because he is a vegan so i have to think about that bye that still leaves my youngest brother who only eats quite specific things and then he will not eat food that is touching in the wrong way and then my dad eats normally but he does not like soup and my mum is a pescetarian but nonetheless i am going to be thinking to them so i guess i am going to be thinking creatively  but it is not every day and it is i am saying that paying little or no rent is it is the least i can do so i think i will just get much more inventive you and i think i will learn not to stress about it so much because i just physically can not stress about if it is perfect or not if i am cooking it 3 days a week my response would be well if you would rather have something else for dinner you can make it yourself then yeah i am the one cooking tonight and you are going to get what i make you but then the other thing is when i am moving with a partner he eats a lot of meat i do not we will have to work that out somehow yeah i mean i am sure wherever you go you might be able to find a good sustainable meat source and i do not know there are also stuff out there like sort of subscription based things that you can can get it directly from the producer or something like that you can get some good kinds of meat every week and get that directly from some local farm or something like that and support some sort of local business and so on you might be able to get something like that see my worry about that is like for chicken and stuff i understand it completely it is high welfare that would be fantastic and it is not traveling that much however they like steak cows are already massive co 2 producers you so the environmental worry for me will be to stick to basically which sort of animal i go for whereas you just tend not to eat meat at all i think you said you do eat meat sometimes if it has been like i do not think you said hunted or something i do not eat any meat because i do not like wild meat and no did you not eat something that someone had hunted for you at some point i am remembering wrong yes well my bye do like wild meat but that was one of my reasons for going vegetarian because i do not like that meat 0 my goodness wild me do you mean the type of me or the way it was taken no the type of meat so that is wild boar or like game meat yes ah not a huge fan i think there is something so medieval about going and cooking a pheasant yeah i would love to do it once to see what it is like but there is something so base about it or a swan are so rare you can not you can not do that where were they formed pheasants okay yeah fair enough i have seen this rare in swans but i am not allowed to kill a swan i had a friend actually when he was at uni he had a student living with him who got kicked out of uni permanently because he killed and ate a swan he was not mad or anything he just saw it in a pond and was like well i am going to have that and stick it home desperate i just think that is quite strange i do not think i would ever want me that badly to just pick up a duck and go home with it i do not know where that duck has been nope me neither (EDACC-C11-00)
hi i am participant c 33 b p 2 hi i am participant c 33 b p one i am going to read the passage please call stella ask her to bring these things with her from the store 6 spoons of fresh snow peas 5 thick slabs of blue cheese and maybe a snack for her brother bob we also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids she can scoop these things into 3 red bags and we will go meet her wednesday at the train station i will now read the little passage please call stella ask her to bring these things with her from the store 6 spoons of fresh snow peas 5 thick slabs of blue cheese and maybe a snack for her brother bob we also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids she can scoop these things into 3 red bags and we will go meet her wednesday at the train station yeah bye shall we talk about our favorite things about edinburgh yeah that stood out to me do you want to start yeah i think like compared with living in london before i like the scale of edinburgh i like the fact you can walk everywhere and like being able to leave somewhere like when you are tired and not needing to spend like an hour getting home on the tube is so nice like no matter kind of where i am in the city it is like it is going to take me half an hour to get home because the 1st thing that i did not notice moving here is i think the people of i do not know if this applies to all people in the uk but i feel the people in edinburgh are very open and easy to talk to and it is very easy to make friends and meet new people in edinburgh that is definitely not true of london that is definitely not the whole uk one thing that has like now recently i think that i have started to like more and more is the biking infrastructure not necessarily in the sector but sort of around edinburgh it is so nice to just bike sort of in the in the is it called the city proper of edinburgh like they have really yeah i think i know what you mean really good like these biking highways and you can go very far on a bike and just like see you know old castles and nature and the beach i really really appreciate that about edinburgh now i need to rent a bike and come with you on one of these trips i am i have not cycled in so long like i do not know cycling in london seems kind of terrifying i did cycle a bit at uni but it was such a small city i always thought like where my accommodation was and where my lectures were i may as well have just walked pretty much because it was quicker to walk through like the footpaths than bike round so i did not use it that much yeah it was definitely terrifying to start biking in edinburgh like i literally i think i just like carried the bike most of the way back from portobello but yeah it is gotten easier now thankfully most drivers are you know aware of cyclists and so yeah getting easier and easier how do you find biking up the hills because that is the thing i like this was one thing that i meant to mention as well so from edinburgh to the west it is all quite flat and decent and very chill everything up to the south and sort of southeast and actually southwest as well is like terrifyingly hilly i am and i still have not challenged myself to do any sort of like a long biking tour in those directions but i mean along the coast either to the west or to the east so to the east towards north berwick or to the west towards bowness is very very manageable for like everyone  i would say i would like to get out of edinburgh more just cause like i do not know there is so much beautiful countryside around that you do not really need to travel very far to see like going like when i went to loch lomond recently like that was so nice and like i probably yeah i could like rent a car or i think that is public transport to get there it is just like a little bit more awkward than renting a car how long was the drive there i feel like it was definitely less than 2 hours you maybe like an hour and a half okay yeah something like that and like yeah there is just so many places like when i went on holiday last year like we went up to the south of the cairngorms and again it was like a couple of hours drive and it was like such such beautiful countryside and so different from where i grew up as well which is nice like and yeah like the other day i went to go pick up some furniture from this is exactly my experience as well i felt like i was always going sort of the same routes and seeing the same things every day and then now that i have the bike and just like you know taking that as just like if i want to exercise instead of just you know running on a treadmill and seeing nothing for an hour just like bike i have never liked treadmills for that reason so and just like if i am going to run i want to see like i used to when i ran a lot in london i used to like i had a watch it was not quite as sophisticated as like a garment or whatever but it told you where you would come from like it pointed a little arrow as to how to get back home and kind of mapped your route on a little line so like if you were out for a run it would be you could kind of look like it would not show you the roads but it would show you like okay so i ran like southeast and southwest for a bit and so i need to kind of retrace myself yeah how are you finding placents yeah i think like i have gotten to a good schedule now it is not too busy when i go because it is quite late in the evenings and i guess most people work out like straight after work whatever i am there when it is like all the fucking bros not like anyone is being bro y but it is like pretty much all guys i guess maybe that is true for a weightlifting gym a lot of the time but yeah there will be like i do not know there is like a couple of guys i am starting to recognize who like work out in pairs and they like hype each other up 10 tech all the tech boys come swarming and i am like yeah but i was like i do not work for them i just they gave me this free t shirt but now i do not want to wear it to the gym because it is just really awkward like no i think i do not have a job i just have a free i i just i could not turn down free clothes yeah are the opposite of what you are expecting yeah like twice and the 1st time i was like 0 this is kind of funny the 2nd time i was like i need to stop wearing this t shirt too cringe unwanted attention yeah they were very friendly it was just like awkward because i was just like no i am not really like a real person who works for this company i am just like poor and wanted a free t shirt yeah i mean like i am hoping to be going more to the gym this summer i hope what they say is true that like during summer it kind of drops down in terms of attendance because now after covid restrictions kind of lifted it has been so busy there when do you tend to go one yeah you mean when during the week or just when i am yeah yeah like when during the week like what kind of time 0 i do not know i like to go as many times as possible but sometimes like i would typically go in the afternoon because i feel like i am the type of like worker or like like my work habit is that like it needs i require a lot of time to sort of get in the mood of working and once i am there i am like so fixated on what i am doing but yeah that is right i think i would struggle to have like a midday gym break i really miss being able to so i used to work at a place that was like just on top of a gym and i used to do exactly this like go at 12 every day and it was so nice because it you know you got a bit of a break from just work and back then i could sort of easily settle in to just working again and it was really nice maybe i can just sort of retrain that habit or yeah why do you think it is changed because you are doing a phd yeah it is just like different kind of work and like it just requires you know different kind of thinking and like stuff like that like i was just doing like what development and that is kind of like just like do this and do that and it is very like these steps that you just follow and it is easy to just jump back on that list of things that you have to do you but yeah like i have literally when i have broken up my day during my phd i have literally like i swear i had an idea you what was that idea again so i like have so little control over whether my brain is in focus mode or non focus mode so i have a list of things to do and i will either do them like not like at the same time but i will sometimes like jump between things much more frequently and then sometimes i do get like quite in the zone but i do not try and like i guess like kind of control when that happens because my brain is just its own entity i am also like i am a serial like what is it called like when you delay everything like procrastinator yes that is what i am i am a procrastinator and it has always worked for me in the past because like stress has been kind of helpful it just like pushes me forward so like i work you know just a tiny tiny amount for the 1st 3 weeks and then i am like busy for the last week and now obviously i was you know moving to a different country during this annual review ugh you i have never done that i just stopped thinking i like i just do not understand i guess cause i am like the opposite of a procrastinator like when i have something to do i want to do it straight away and i was saying this the other day to my partner like i feel like on monday i am really really productive because i will have a to do list and it is like my brain is like we must do everything like today it is like i generate and then i sort of tail off but it means that like if i am like it is it tended to be like if i was like revising for an exam i would have to try and like is this like specific to like the phd or like in general or i think i have i do not i really hate doing things last minute like i just get so anxious and stressed out i am definitely like someone who likes to have like plans and know what to expect and stuff so like i have always been someone who like tries to kind of like start things early and pace things yeah i just do not like that feeling of like being under pressure and not having enough time how about we talk about something less like stressful you and we have talked about holidays do you have any holidays planned i am going to disneyland 0 my god i was so excited i freaking love disneyland where in france yeah yeah and i am so excited i went with my the same friend i am going with like a few years ago we just had the best time and we are like we should just definitely just do this again i think we both have a similar approach of like i do not know we are quite like cynical people but there is like a special place in our heart for really childish things  i am like very like capitalism blah this blah that and then i am just like but disney and like christmas i like i hate valentine is day because i am like it is just this commercial nightmare blah blah blah blah blah but then i am like but christmas time i love it you yeah i think it kind of surprises people how much i love disneyland but i love disneyland just like the whole world they have created the amount of effort the fact that everyone is there just to have a fun time and be childish and like bye i saw the funniest video the other day of like someone proposing at disneyland but they were standing in like a like an area they were not meant to be in did you see this and the staff member just like around just like right this guy should be fired by now i was 100% with him 0 as soon as you let one couple do it everyone is going to do it and they are all going to be on the forbidden stage with like the pyrotechnics and stuff i was like i bet they are trained to do that like it does not matter what people are doing if they are in a forbidden area you get them out of the way i was honestly like i was all for him i was like yes everyone in the comments obviously was like this guy like no one could be paying him enough to like be this much of a joy sucker or whatever like why does this person hate love to be honest based on the video it did not seem like it was his 1st rodeo snatching a exactly this probably happens all the time people are like 0 i will not get a photo where there is other people in the way i will stand in this nice stage area where there is no one there but as soon as you let one couple do it they are all going to be fricking doing it  ah yeah public i basically just like always sided with starving staff over the public i i am saying in public we suck we deserve to have our brains snatched so you have been once before to disneyland bye or twice before and was it both times in france yeah i have not been to any of the other ones i would like to go to the one in japan as part of my dream tour of japan that i will do one day when i am finally fluent have you seen the new mario world no i think you were telling me about this though it is i think i have seen like a clip of it maybe it literally looks like a super mario level it is very high detail and once you get into the park it is just like everything looks like a computer game and they have all these like you know if there is like a you know like in a mario game they will have like a question block and if you like you know punch it a coin will come out so like everyone when they come into the park they get like this little bracelet and then you can go bling bling yeah yeah it is so like yeah so well done i really want to go there and if i am lucky i might be able to do like a short trip to japan after korea that is if they lift the traveling restrictions for japan which i would love love to go to japan i am really hoping that there will be like the bias related workshop or like conference in japan at some point that i can like go to i mean i want to go anyway and like it is one of the like not a big fan of like long haul flights for the environmental impact but it is not a country you can practically get to any other way you but i feel like yeah it would be like the dream holiday yeah all these years of attempting to learn japanese finally worth it yeah i am just like i am very excited about the food in particular this is a food culture that i can really like like japanese or korean or korean probably japanese as well i mean but yeah i have a korean friend here in iceland and she cooks the most amazing food it is just it is so like in some sense it kind of reminds me of like not taste wise but like traditional korean food kind of reminds me of traditional italian food in that it is very like few and simple traditional british food is just like we had loads of meat so we ate the meat okay traditional english food is like we mashed together the spices we stole from various countries and some raisins and then we served it with a meat gruel delicious that is like like like traditional christmas pudding mince pies it is just like spices and raisins spices and raisins what is a gruel gruel i do not know like a thick sloppy gravy you yeah that is how i would describe a gruel it is it is like a savory soupy sort of baby food ish type of thing like it is not like fancy it is old fashioned term it is not something someone would like cook but you might describe something as a gruel like 0 it is like i do not know if you have noticed this or if there is any truth to this and you happen to know but i feel like with old culinary words often they kind of sound like what they would sound in i feel like rule just kind of sounds right for description you just made of it like on a max appear almost yeah yeah that is like particularly true in icelandic where like a stew is kassa and like whenever i hear the word kassa i just imagine like the sound of like a ladle going into a stew like kassa yeah it could have an influence on what words stick like we do associate certain sounds with certain types of meaning like there is this test it is like kiki and the other one is called baba i think but it is like 2 shapes and you ask anyone like which one is kiki and which one is baba and kiki is the spiky one like obviously because like it is a spiky sound so it would not surprise me if like there is quite a lot of like japanese language has a lot of sort of they call it it is called onomatopoeia but it is not pika pika i mean obviously that is what pikachu says does that have a meaning i have a feeling it means something like yeah it does it means glitter i thought so it means it does mean something i thought it meant like flashing things glitter so yeah that is like an example of like a pattern there is a few more like they are obviously all immediately gone from my head but there is a few more like like i do not know just like repeated sound pairs like that where it kind of is a bit like onomatopoeia there is a good bit in my favorite book yeah passage passage but is it kiki baba is that the experiment i think so one of them is definitely called kiki but i can not remember the other one is called like bobo or bobo or something like that you but it is like a round fluffy shape it is like a cloud versus like a star kind of shape you but they have done it to people like all over the world and regardless of your native language it seems to be most people think kiki is a spiky shape i wonder if that has like changed a little bit after like you know kiki started meaning like let us have a kiki that is not general enough though that is too obscure because there is a club here in iceland called kiki and like now when someone says kiki to me i think of something like more you know soft and fluffy than before you know maybe it would influence you i think you are average person  well so you know about the experiments so it is not going to work on you anyway yeah i would just be like 0 they are both soft and fluffy to me yeah yeah i do not think that is mainstream enough to have an influence so if we go back to disneyland is there anything in particular that you are excited for the rides or just the experience the whole shabam like the rides i do like rides especially they are so good with the way they use video as well it is like really cool and then like we stayed in a hotel that was like designed like a castle not like the most expensive fancy one they offer but like one of the less fancy expensive ones but it still had like a castle vibe like there was like random like medieval statues and stuff around the place like and like 0 yeah yeah coco coco in rio right yeah i think maybe yeah i have not seen a lot of the newer disney i am i am an og disney fan but yeah i am just like you know there is like a kind of little like paddle boat so like some of the areas unnecessarily specific to like a movie i guess the paddle boat is like the very early like the 1st mickey mouse thing i think it is like well maybe it is a steamboat but anyway like i just yeah going between the different worlds and like i do not know there is something nice about being there with people especially the time of year we are going like where everyone is loads of people that are like big fans and they have like what about like like i have been thinking about going to alton towers yeah that is good obviously not as like themed or like prestigious as disneyland but like you know something close enough to edinburgh to travel to although i have to say like i have looked at traveling to that like alton towers is like in the middle of nowhere it again because i feel like i like went there so it must be near where well not necessarily near where i grew up but like driving it is like wait is that another one there is one like out like between sheffield and birmingham is there another alton towers 0 i was just going to say because i have been to alton is house but i do not remember driving that freaking far i guess i was not the one driving i guess we just especially where it is i am like that would actually be really awkward to get to from where i come from because where i came from had no freaking roads that worked i do not remember going that far yeah it must have been a dream or maybe there is literally another one i do not know maybe i want to another one but the i think i am pretty certain i went to alton towers  and like i guess we just drove i was not the one driving so i was probably like a sleeper half of it yeah the biggest one in iceland like an amusement park it has a brilliant name like this is it is so literal it is called fjolskyldu og hustirakarurinn and it means the family and farm animal park and on the family side what they have is like a go kart track and like you know the thing that spins and you ride on a horse 0 carousel carousel is it that is it yeah that is it when it comes to the family side and then they just have like cows and pigs that sounds like a village fair like the village show or like the county show that would happen like once a year and they would be like you know animal stuff and i like when i was growing up there was only the go kart thing there was no carousel i will go with you to all of the towers i would love that yeah so so like i do not know this happened like maybe 10 years ago they were like okay we were going to add a thing to the park and there was like a special like group of people that went abroad and tested all sorts of new amusement park rides and then they were like came back and they brought a freaking carousel with them i love the idea that they like i do not know got to irwin and then did not get any further than like a village fate and we are like 0 this must be the height of pentatubus 0 yeah i would love to go to alton towers i really like rides and just you know i mean we kind of did that once the one in the meadow you almost puked to be honest you you that one was pretty rough i think those kind of ones the touring ones they always put me a little bit on edge because like i do not know something like 0 in towers i feel like has like a regular maintenance schedule yeah i trust like not that the village wants to untrustworthy because i think like but it is just like it is often they are both probably run by kids but at least at alton is house i feel like the kids are not being managed by other kids right right is the vibe i get from most touring ones sometimes i do not know especially because they are i think it is the fact that like the touring ones are not like screwed into the ground that is what i want i want the reassurance that this thing has been like built into the concrete exactly and has not been like put up like 2 days prior as well yeah yeah just like a little bit more like comforted i still go on those like touring ones and like they are fun i mean i am not dead yet so yeah yeah it is like 0 old town tower it is a little bit more like foundation well time is up time is up do we have a final message i think we just stopped it there yeah all right (EDACC-C17-00)
okay i think it is recording and you should all go into the correct place so hi i am c 47 p one hi i am c 47 p 2 perfect so i guess i can start reading the text and then we can switch to just chatting okay so please call stella ask her to bring these things with her from the store 6 spoons of fresh snow peas 56 slabs of blue cheese and maybe a snack for her brother bob we also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids she can scoop these things into 3 red bags and we will go meet her wednesday at the train station okay please call stella ask her to bring these things with her from the store 6 spoons of fresh snow peas 5 thick slaps of blue cheese and maybe a snack for her brother bob we also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids she can scoop these things into 3 red bags and we will go meet her wednesday at the train station cool yep right so i think we are done now so we need to finish this conversation in 15 minutes so that would be i am actually not sure i think 15 minutes is the minimum but you can go on for longer yeah we could go for longer but why yeah why did i do it yeah also i think zoom automatically started stopping at 40 minutes in  it used to be unlimited for 2 people but now for some reason it only allows you 40 minutes interesting very interesting yeah i wonder what changed you i am pasting so they gave us some conversation topics  in case we did not know each other do we know each other i do not know do we thank you so yeah i thought maybe we can talk about that considering we spoke yesterday and a few hours ago yeah sure why not okay yeah so but but yeah like before we go into a 1st conversation i was going to ask do you do what what did you do did you have dinner yeah i did yep i did what did you have spaghetti yeah spaghetti pasta as as every student has yeah the past yeah i think i have reached a point where i just could not eat any more penne pasta like even now it just makes me sad bye so you never order it wow in a restaurant how often did you eat it maybe once a week there was a time when i mean yeah okay that sounds like my situation yeah basically my situation right now yeah i used to buy these jars of pasta sauce and i think i would probably use maybe 13rd or one half of it for one meal and then save the rest for another day and i just feed myself like that okay so yeah my friends i used to eat them with ketchup i am just spaghetti but my friends made fun of me of that so right now i try to just make my own sauces yeah i mean were they italian no they are not not a talent they are bulgarian well by that they think it is disgusting but i think they do not understand it is probably true i mean i remember when we used to go to babicka is place and she used to make spaghetti with ketchup and great i think it was special occasions when that happened like feta cheese and yeah no was a treat maybe it did not go as often who did that bye yeah yeah he probably still does it maybe i am confusing my memory as well yeah thank you you i guess i do not know for me when i move from one place to another it feels that all of my previous memories become so much more distant and it is so much harder to access them thank you yeah including recent memories for example things that happened before 2016 seem to me like in a different life that is possible yeah yeah i can start relating to that yeah i guess you still have not moved you enough exactly  do you want to go to the questions i am sorry sure which one grabs your attention i have not read them all so let me see did you ever play a sport or have another hobby as a kid did you play any sports i mean play sports i used to play yeah play a lot of sports but i never did play a certain sport for a long time bye i started with i think table tennis when i was really young you before school even i did that so you remember him then yeah it was in the like i do not know what the sports hall and 0 i should have wrote it scott but yeah have a good one it was in the basement over there how old were you i think i was like 6 bye i do not think i started going to school back then not sure wow or 1st or 2nd grade something like that okay i was really young then i remember in school they gave like discounted lessons for proper tennis  so yeah 0 yeah remember when you used please to go for that yeah yeah i went for that then one of my friends got kicked out from there from the tennis club bye because he insulted one of the coaches 0 no yeah do i know this person maybe no we should not be using any names you so let us keep this anonymous yep wow i still talk to him today but yeah okay well tell me after this call out there so yeah that is us then i think i would did basketball you i played basketball for some time was it at school yeah it was in middle school thank you 5th to 6th grade i played basketball i feel like a really bad sister because i did not know i mean you are like i was away the whole time yeah you were away it is still like i wish i knew all of these people i mean i did not practice basketball that often or something the that big of a big of a part of in my life so yeah  thank you do it with friends no i did it alone i do not know why even you i think there was like one classmate who did and it was 0 cool you are playing basketball i want to try as well bye yeah thanks it was not great all right bye for now did you do anything else i did swimming for like i remember that one yeah hi to long term yeah did you do any sports by the way i do not remember you doing any not much i think i did maybe badminton when i was thank you primary school okay at the sports hall as well maybe for like 2 months probably and then i remember thank you i was a month in and i was feeling like i have learned things i am progressing and then someone arrived and within 2 days she was better than i was after a whole month wow i just felt so bad and demotivated and i thought there is something wrong with me and i am not made for this and yeah i did not have great self confidence back in the day especially about sports and then i did a little bit of swimming but like the 1st time i got a bad cold so then mom did not want to let me keep going of course and then the 2nd time i probably just started doing it again i can not remember after what time period maybe a year maybe a few months and i remember i hit my toe in like this little concrete platform thing that was on the ground i just did not see it and i was like walking and i hit my toe and the thing and then i do not think i broke my toe but it was hurt so then i just did not go back for ever i think that was the end bye i just thought this is not for me and then as you know i started doing dancing in high school and i decided probably to thank you that this is the sport for me yeah even though it is not very sporty i mean it is physically intensive somewhat it can be okay it is up to you if you make it okay yeah yeah i guess bye yeah and then since coming here i did try running actually for 0 well to pitch i am speaking one of the the question well back when i was doing my phd in the phd flat i used to run maybe every other sunday with my flatmates or actually with one of my flatmates who shall not be named because of the experiment privacy but exactly then the other flatmate joined us once and he was really badly hungover i am and he was still so much better than both of us that is just so depressing i mean yeah i think we stopped doing that i do not think hangover really affects your running performance maybe i do not know i guess it depends on the thank you how sick you feel but you know yeah it depends and then now i am doing yoga which i would recommend to anyone yeah i remember one time when you went back for holidays in bulgaria you wanted to go running and that made fun of you that is a good environment to promote sporting activities right yeah exactly yeah  i think i probably did once and then yeah it was too intensive and i did not want to do it again so to just do awkward or something like that or maybe talk riddhya you i think with these things it is just good to have really small goals like almost non existent goals 0 thank you guys the best thing is to have someone to do it with yeah both of you can yep yeah yeah it is really hard to find someone to do it with though you in yoga i was actually really lucky this year because one of my friends trained to be a yoga teacher well she has this kind of really unlimited pass for this one yoga studio and she lives nearby and she tried to convince me to go with her sometimes so we started this routine on saturday morning we tried to go to yoga and then after that we go out for a coffee and breakfast or in french which you make fun of i am going to have some brunch exactly brunch for old ladies  and actually i think that became a really good routine because i now want to go even if we are not going to have brunch after that yeah that is nice it is now intrinsically rewarding as opposed to extrinsically yep it is good i mean that is what i am doing right now with my roommate we are going to bye planning together  yeah it is awesome if one of us is feeling lazy the other one is pushing him to go have you ever been the one who is pushing yeah sure 0 wow go share i am impressed well yeah good so what has it been like going climbing what kind of level do you feel you are at at the moment do you i am still kind of beginner thank you yeah but i am starting to the most promising the best thing with coming is that there are different levels and they are quite well panned out i think i should say i am yeah and it is very clear when you are making progress like it is really noticeable because there are so many levels you can go to you yeah how many thank you i mean i think like the level starts from 4 which is just like extremely easy stuff like anyone 1st time could do it and then they go up to like 789 so like right now i am at 66 wow and they have like 6 big thank you which is sometimes tricky but they are not just difficult not that difficult there when it gets way harder it scales exponentially i should say the levels so yeah 6 is pretty average still 7 is sounds like towards the upper end of the no no no upper than this like 778 yeah we will be right back this way to get or like 6 c like these things for me right now are impossible although i am thank you i am doing like 6 bits thank you like i cannot even like get one hold correctly like i cannot stand the wall  a 2nd so yeah okay well one of my friends occasionally does climbing and he keeps talking about how much difference it makes what your body type is and to certain things that are super easy for a short person are really difficult for a tall person and vice versa exactly yeah yeah yeah this is exactly right 0 yeah sometimes because we are like a bit taller than our bye than average we can just skip some quotes you this makes it so much easier like infinitely times more easier because if i were shorter person like i would actually have to do the difficult holds but yeah i will say conchita yeah i am literally we are literally cheating i see yeah but of course like when you have to squeeze or coat somewhere it can be bad if you are dull so yeah and yeah that same friend of mine finds that his finger strength is not very good his joints are not very strong yeah well thank you well yeah of course but for timing like this is finger strength is the most important thing so bye yeah so it is about that yeah that is the thing yeah the main exercise is just to hold like hank and just on your fingers bye yay used to do pull ups i remember you were really good at that thank you very much does that help it is mandatory okay yeah yeah i am a bit of a shmanko thanks a lot you have to be really good and you are like sometimes a lot of things like on a lot of walls you just have to do them with an awkward angle you basically have to pull yourself up  and it requires a lot of strength  yeah i think maybe yeah that is why it is not for me because i well it depends well there are like walls that work it depends on the incline of the wall all right like if the inquireness i am not sure if it is negative but if it is smaller yeah yeah if it is like that yeah then you have to it is a lot of strength yeah but sometimes they are like slightly like negative i should say  so you can lean on the wall bye and just balance which is way more fun for me yeah just make some balancing  i that is good and have you ever met anyone through this you yeah yeah i have met 2 people which are mutual friends of georgi  whoops i think that is a fairly common name yeah let us see i whoops yeah yeah i have met 2 friends okay i respect mutual friends okay i am not going to say names do not yeah i mean if you were going to say a name that is like a pretty common name so country  yeah but yeah speaking of names i have been doing a little bit of you know part of my job is to record people for experiments as well bye and the recordings are supposed to be anonymous bye i am interacting with small children and i have a lot of fun to encourage them and keep them motivated to do the task so last when was it i think it was on was it yesterday yeah it was yesterday it feels like ages ago i recorded this tiny kid and i said his name in one of the recordings so now i went back to the audio and it is easy enough to just cut out that is what yep i am kind of challenging myself to cut it out in a way that does not sound like there is anything missing so that is also possible to do often bye there are ways of modifying recordings yeah so of 0 is that although how can you manage to keep the kids anonymous i mean you just do not you just say you are and like 0 you are doing such a great job what if the kid decides to say a name 0 no they do not do not really have a reason to because i am asking them to say very specific words and also quite often although not always their intelligibility is quite low anyway so you even if they say something it will not be understood because of their condition you yeah it has not been a problem but i can imagine if we are having a conversation it could become one it is just me keeping them on task and the task is for them to read words yeah 0 they are just reading quotes okay yeah exactly so it is not really conversational  yeah just looking at the other questions i think we are towards the end this anyway yeah i think so too thank you i think we were maybe i am not sure  do you have a timer i should have but you know that would have been smart wow you are the smart one in this family yeah yeah no so i think we started at 35 past yeah let me see yeah 0 i think we can tell yeah 20 minutes ago well we can talk for like 2 or 3 more minutes yeah just to round it up so what are your you plans for the rest of the evening i am just going to play games with we have someone someone who not been mentioned yet bye and that is it and then i am going to go to sleep good  yeah i need to reply to work emails because i do not have work life balance and also get ready for a trip because tomorrow  the person that i live with is going to come around and pick me up from work and work is in glasgow so you then we are going to drive off to this event for the weekend so i will not be home again for a couple of days i am and i feel a bit stressed out because i like being at home in the evenings and making myself i am going to go cozy and comfortable well okay but yeah socializing has to happen at some point they say it is good for you thank you yeah you that is what i am going to do well if you do not like going out there not for a long time i like it in controlled amounts okay and knowing that i can always go back home thank you but when we are going to be away in a social environment yeah i can not just leave you know no going back it is like in the world of the rings thank you the mindset morning yeah you cool i think we should be able to wrap this up yep i think so too okie doke that it is enough i am stopping it (EDACC-C22-00)
is it recording then now it is recording okay i have a record button as well but it is okay it is fine okay so i think that you can start i should state my participation number yeah i am c 49 p one and i am c 39 p 2 now you should read the passage that you have in the document all right please call stella ask her to bring these things with her from the store 6 spoons of fresh snow peas 5 thick slabs of blue cheese and maybe a snack for her brother bob we also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids she can scoop these things into 3 red bags and we will go meet her wednesday at the train station okay i will read it as well please call stella ask her to bring the things with her from the store 6 spoons of fresh snow peas 56 slabs of blue cheese and maybe a snack for her brother bob we also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids she can scoop these things into 3 red bags and we will go meet her wednesday at the train station okay so that was a weird passage i am fine i have had a busy week but now it is coming to an end and i have had some problems with my flatmates because they seem to be a bit dirty okay and you can say this out loud now because maybe they know already yeah they probably have already noticed that i am not very happy with the state of our house okay so so which is the part that is more dirty would you say is it the bathroom or in general the kitchen and stuff yeah which is the part that is more annoying to you i think there is not a specific part that is annoying it is just the accumulation of fields yeah after many days you see a lot of dust in the stairs after many days you see a lot of bread crumbs in the kitchen counter you are welcome you see a lot of pubic hairs on the bathroom in the sink in the yes how you call it this thing where the water comes out like in the bath it is a dream the drain yeah yeah yeah on the drain thank you for watching 0 no but we can not even it is such a yeah i am the only brunette but my 2 of my flatmates are slightly blonde so i know that all of those careers are in my head how is the cleaning in your house do you live with flatmates or do you live by yourself yeah yeah that is an interesting question because i think that right now i have flatmates but they are extremely keen 50 or 60 year old flatmates which actually it is interesting because they used to complain a lot about me so they are my parents and they used to complain a lot about me and i am complaining now about them because they have a cleaning lady that comes every day which i think is extreme and they get used to do some like the house is clean all the time but they tend to thank you well i think that life you start like being yourself in the bands when you are born and you end up being yourself in the band when you die yeah yeah yeah yeah and i think that now i can see this little switch that i am telling them what they are doing wrong and and these things keep increasing i think day by day thank you and was a month i am studying a masters and we have a teaching assistant that is an italian guy that just had a newborn child and the other day we went to the pub and he was telling us i do not know a lot of things that i did not know about babies like for example you need to press them so they will shit really 0 no really okay owen i want one month baby newborn he has but he was so amazed also at the is that true it is like a doll or something yeah i think it is similar he was very sweet he was telling us like the whole process of his partner giving birth and i do not know he is really excited about it it is really sweet to see but i always wonder because he stays in the pub until very late with us and then who is pressing the kid to poo who is the president the pooping pressing yeah because i think they are well organized though because i think she works during the day and she is with the baby during the day thank you yeah yeah that is something very interesting for me how like now i have like a couple of friends that have babies and it is interesting how they converge to slightly different strategies and yeah i mean at the end it seems that everything worked out but everyone has their own like strategies of yeah for instance i remember that adri used to wake up at 3 a m and is with the baby until 7 or 8 a m while the other person yes yes yes but it does like the thing that he thinks that is the hardest is that he is not getting much sleep that he is very sleep deprived but he says that you kind of get used to it like it is like now i think if i have a night that i do not sleep well my whole day is ruined but if suddenly you have a sight then you are going to have a lot of nights that you do not sleep well you have to learn to live with yeah we used to be like that actually when i was in the us i used to sleep like super badly every day and suddenly the weekend arrived and i could sleep for 8 hours and i was like 0 fuck that is completely amazing it was like that your normal life becomes horrible and then suddenly when you have a good night of sleep then your day is amazing so it is a little bit yeah interesting yeah i have my father that is i told him that i would be in this conversation but he keeps texting me you know asking for things okay okay that is fine that is fine yeah we can look i was thinking that that is interesting because we are partners or associates yeah but there are some of the things that i do not know about you like we propose some conversation topics to have yes okay and the 1st one of them funny enough it is what is your favorite hobbies what is my favorite chagis always because we were looking for topics of conversation and i think that at that time we were having our conversation about hobbies and stuff and i thought what people have in the uk and i said hobbies that is true well i think this is a trap question because i do not believe in hobbies i think hobbies are also like they change throughout the country origin i think some countries we do not tend to have a lot of hobbies at least i feel like in my surrounding friends in barcelona okay okay but do i ever had one hobby i do not know i am trying to think about it i have to choose one like something that was close to be a hobby but it was not like maybe climbing at some point climbing eh 0 wow and that is interesting yes that is interesting at some point yes i would go to there is a place in barcelona you can climb called la fusarda that is open for the the open one or the i i know like we said yeah the oven one and then i would go to these great what you used to go to the tunnel yeah bye and there was this boulder center in poblano called deuditz 10 fingers the leads yeah yeah yeah i was there during the opening actually brilliant yeah yeah the 1st day where they opened 0 wow bye and then sometimes i would go on the weekend to climb but that was the closest to a hobby i think i have ever been okay okay that is very nice actually it is a very nice habit i used to climb a lot as well i was not considering it a habit it was more like 0 wow this will sound super cool a way of life no no no no no i mean it is it is yeah can i hope you become a way of life yeah i think so so a little bit yeah so i had to stop to stop climbing i was climbing very strongly actually in edinburgh before meeting you again i think but very very strongly like i used to go there 4 times a week and training and stuff wow yeah yeah yeah but suddenly i am like i think i read somewhere that climbing is the worst sport that you can do for your body or something like 0 really super bad yeah yeah yeah for all these joins and stuff it is extremely bad i think that this and skateboarding actually did you ever do that no but my best friend used to be obsessed with skateboarding and i used to go with him at macba yes barcelona is one of the most famous street skate cities in the world yeah so all the pro skaters were coming to magba and i used to study in the university next to that place and max used to be there like doing skateboarding well i there was a library there okay so i used to go there all the afternoons and when i finished i used to go with max and max was doing peace but it was interesting because you would have seen him doing some tricks and i thought wow that is very cool and everyone was like no no that is normal and when they do something that for me was not impressive everyone was like wow everyone was applauding and stuff like you do not understand the codes of skating i do not understand the codification but it is interesting because they do and it is something very private or something and i remember there was a very nice guy that i got very not in love but it was like a very small child of like maybe 10 years old or something go called misa houston he was from the us i think he is jamaican or something with dreadlocks like with 12 years old so a small child like yeah yeah yeah like as much as in a way eh like a small adult in the body of a small yeah yeah yeah because he was like with this flow and he was doing all the tricks and he was like 12 years old you know and everyone was like 0 and with the dreadlocks you know he was super cute and his father was recording the videos as well and i thought that this was a very nice i do not know and i used to go there and max knew that i liked him a lot like i like to watch him and every time that he was in barcelona i used to go there and just observe him i like this interaction between and now he is an adult and he is extremely famous and stuff really he is famous yeah yes he was famous already when he was 12 years old but they used to come there well famous in the skate skate world yeah in the skateboard which i do not know it can be globally famous but yeah and climbing was a big part of my life as well we used to do road trips around europe climbing with vans and stuff and there i met a lot of people who were really crazy about climbing and it was a big part of their lives i think and how did you start learning that is an interesting question when i was 14 i think it was the time that i started climbing because a friend of mine vito he was a little bit like a stranger because now i see him as like i do not understand why this was the case but he was like i had a lot of admiration for him and i remember i actually i did telecos like the my telecommunications engineering because of him actually  and yeah so part of why i am it is for him i think i do not know i had a lot of admiration for this guy and he used to climb and when winter i remember that i bought some climbing shoes and we start climbing a lot and yeah i do not know i think that he used to be like this badass guy and i was like 0 wow that is cool but then i remember that i started doing my own path and he was more like it is interesting because aubrey kleinberg had his own philosophy and i think that for vito was more like an alpinist in the sense of like his goal was to reach the top of a mountain  and i was more a sportist climber which means that you prefer to do tricks and you do not care about arriving so for him his goal is to just do like a super big mountain let us say and if there is climbing in the middle he will climb for me climbing is a goal by itself yeah i know what you mean okay that is all about hobbies favorite or less favorite game or sport or film or music game okay game that as a child or as an adult as a as a adult i will come out as quite a negative person that does not like hobbies and does not like games yeah i know that what is using your spare time i think we will go to the bar bye i am an autopholic i go to the bathroom i am an alcoholic no i have a game that i like it is called secret code and it is a card game that you play you make 2 teams with your friends and there is in each card there is a drawing and they are kind of very like oniric drawings that have different elements in them ah 0 wow i played this recently was it with you or not like very recently actually no i do not think i have never played that who played this with with garcia and all that people actually that is the only one i like actually because my former flatmates back in barcelona used to do a lot of board games on sundays i people over and most of the time i would be hungover and pissed that there was people in the living room but sometimes i would hang out with them and then one day this friend brought this game and i really liked it and it is the only game i ever bought i bought it for the house is this one that you have like drawings but very strange drawings yeah very simple drawings you have to say i do not know the red cap on the wall or something yeah so like you have a little card with a secret code it is like you are a spy and then you have 5 cards by 5 cards on the table so you have got a card of how your secret code works which has 6 cards that are like blue and 6 are red ah okay no no no no i am talking about something completely different i thought it was a but then you say like 3 cards 3 on submarine you you can only say one word and the quantity of cards so you have to try to find the relations between the drawings and discuss with your team but also i do not know i think i am not very good at playing games because i remember that sometimes when i play this game they will tell me i was cheating really yeah yeah because i was like doing gestures to my team so they would understand like no no no no i also like that game of putting little papers on your head and you are yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah i like that one and the one of like also putting words i think i like games with words and guessing and like mimicking and all of that but i do not like strategy games or games like risk or something like that or monopoly i like fast paced games what games do you like yeah that is interesting i do not like board games in general actually so when i say that it was like this type of magical thing that happens to us sometimes it is because the other day i was with garci and the blow pipe blow gun guy and we were playing a game that was very interesting actually they give you some maybe it is with the same cards that you play these both versions it is possible yeah i do not know but it was interesting it was very psychological i think but what happens to me with board games is that they get bored yeah i get bored very very fast actually yeah me too it takes me maybe one or 2 rounds to enjoy it i remember this card against humanity i did not understand it much i like that one i remember but once you have played once or twice it is a bit like yeah okay okay we are trying to be really we know it yeah yeah it is just one round game but yeah it is interesting because there in my university in edinburgh everyone is like crazy about games it is crazy i have not seen it much in all my life is there an egg it is not paying any games that you remember playing throughout your life not only like board games but as a child or sometimes yeah yeah yeah i used to play a lot of video games actually and there is this theory i do not know taylor berke patrick that is one of for me is one of the most brilliant researchers from the next generation so i have my advisor my advisor is generation one let us say that next generation was taylor i think you i am in generation so i think that taylor is one of the for me it is one of the best ones and actually he was working in word segmentation at some point as well and i remember that he told me once that he had the theory that people who played games when they were young and stuff it made them think in a different way and i actually actually after some time i have seen a lot of examples of people who were very good at playing games and spend a lot of time playing games like my oldest brother my oldest brother is from the united states your older brother is one example actually i remember that you told me and i thought 0 that is that was a good example oriol vinyals who is one of the leads of deepmind which is a company in london he used to be a champion on starcraft and which is a game it is like an age of empires i do not know if you know it is like you have to build a city and then destroy other cities and stuff like it is like risk or something but with video games and interestingly he later on he thought okay if a machine can solve that problem of playing that game we will be a step forward for artificial intelligence and he spent the last 10 years like working on an algorithm that can play that game bye professional players but yeah there is something that our parents tend to think that okay we are losing time but i think it makes you think in a more strategic way at least it is very program like i think when you are playing that game you try to solve small tasks let us say you think take the video game you divide them in small tasks and then you try to do you still play video games no actually i bought one so i used to play a lot one video game called zelda yes which is a i know you know you know zelda okay so i was so i have this melancholy and for me like because i remember spending a lot of time and i remember connecting a lot with the story when i was young and i do not remember 2 or 3 years ago i said okay i will buy a console and i bought a console i am very bad at playing games by the way so i am not good at all and i bought a console just to play the new version of zelda and i have it here but i have never played with it maybe i played 4 or 6 times yeah that is nice manel is my nephew anyway uncomfortable silence no not uncomfortable it is a comfortable silence yeah so if you could go to holidays anywhere  you cannot say turkey where would that be what would that be i do not know right now i think i really like the idea of going on holidays to visit friends that live in a place you because for me it changes a lot the experience of going so i think i would like to go to mexico i have never been okay now i have a video i would have been to mexico really no 0 wow that is a little bit i have been to mexico actually but to the south of mexico exactly exactly yeah but i have never been to mexico city okay so i would like i have friends that as well yeah that can be a good holiday then well someone that i know very closely really had the idea about going to china and in the beginning i was a bit skeptic like china but now as time goes by i think that it can be more and more interesting and i have a good friend that lived many years in china so maybe that could be a place to visit with this person that really likes take care those are the things i do not know but yeah i really like the idea of connecting with a place with the people that is there i generally like to connect with the people that are there thanks south america but i have been there for a bit but there is something there that i really enjoy would you like to visit some more places in south america because you have been to many i think i would like to visit argentina i have never been i would like to visit brazil we yeah those are places that i have not been to yet central america i would also think i know i think there is something nice about the fact that since i speak spanish you can connect very quickly with people and in a way that maybe somewhere else it is harder sometimes with english but at the same time i think there is also something nice when you cannot communicate because it is a foreign language there is like a sense of opacity of not completely understanding that it is also nice when traveling in enjoy that that is cooling eh what you enjoy that feeling of not being able to i think yes i think there is this idea of also like going somewhere and completely understanding something i think it is a bit off as an idea and him and because it is impossible to understand a whole history or a whole culture with a few days and one has to understand that you will never actually know what is really behind a lot of things i think i got this feeling when i was i lived one year in haiti and there was a lot of things a could not understand their of the culture and at that moment i really had like this whole mindset of wanting to understand everything and and i think it has not been like after a few years that a lot of the experiences i had there for me were very strange or i was not completely comfortable with those experiences because i think i was trying too much to make sense of things that sometimes my rationality is not enough to make sense of or that i do not understand their complexity and it was actually having a conversation with a friend here from my masters that had been in south africa yeah yeah that is super interesting actually what you are saying there are 2 things here i think the 1st one is that this rationality is extremely cultural i think  like we think in terms of our culture and i think that this is a little bit dangerous and this is a 2nd thing because it is something that i do not like and when i see it like suddenly i have tried to like this thing of like trying to put personality about things it makes me think a little bit of colonizing or something like that yeah you see people doing things in a strange way and you start judging it you start judging from this position and suddenly you have like it is happened to me a lot i am not criticizing because i think it is something completely normal and you have to travel a lot and to be exposed to these situations quite often and and like for me i remember in the us i was like judging all the time like 0 these people are eating that or are doing that and that was and now when i think about it like from a from the distance it was a little bit yeah i mean in certain courses that is amazing synchronizing and in other cultures is colonial like for example me not understand like i lived in a very rural place in haiti and there was a lot of spiritism and black magic you and a lot of ways of relating to the world from a sense of being a western person white with a very rational background and rational history of my culture i would question a lot  what they were telling me and like even questioning from a humorous side but i do not know i think like maybe maybe not questioning so much and letting like be more part of it i mean i did in some ways but sometimes i think i was also questioning a lot or like a part of me still does not believe that that man in the market was a zombie because they the they were telling me no in the market there is a zombie like blank shut up like you do not want to believe but it is like this and i do not know i mean there is other ways of experimenting the world and like really putting aside this whole rationality is accepting that it is not our way it is not the best way maybe or the only way no exactly exactly yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah that is the interesting part i think like for me it has been always observed like well not always but learning how to observe without judging because when you start for me when you see this conversation about zombies etc and start saying 0 i do not like that it is like putting some boundaries in the exploration of the world let us say  like for me it is interesting to not have any boundaries and see what you are receiving this could be also dangerous because there are ethical things that i completely disagree for instance there is a chance that i have to go to qatar this year for a conference i did not know that yeah but this is very recent actually but this will be later on in the year not in september october but maybe all right november or something i do not know but there i will have this problem because i have this kind of liberalism about thinking about people etc thank you but then suddenly i will find myself in a society that i disagree with many many things bye about ethical things about women is rights for instance 0 racism or many things that i think are very wrong in that country and then it is like what how should i behave and this is a very tricky question actually yeah although like i feel like certain ways of ruling a country or certain thoughts built on an oppressive understanding bye and i think for me that oppression is problematic either if it is rational or if it is un rational and it is problematic but then there is like another layer to it which is this difference between rationality and what is not and i do not know animism thanks so much it is pretty small you yeah i would not like to i do not like to call it unrational because that is like in a way already advertising yeah yeah but i do not know exactly the words i tend to think there is one funny thing that yeah maybe maybe for me i always thought that religion has something interesting is that it builds a lot of community and good people actually i have one friend of mine in edinburgh well now she will know who she is but she is she is she is mormon and and one thing that surprised me a lot is that she is one of the best person that i have ever known and i think that this is part i do not know i mean it is very hard to tell but  i think that religions have a lot to do with that actually at least christianity i know that maybe it is not perfect but at least at the beginning of times it made me think that being religious can make you a good person and this could be useful at this beginning of whenever everything like there was no ethics or something kind of i think that the relation had a good point let us say but then religion is also an institution that generates certain structures of power i think it is different when religion is something you experience within yourself and then when it becomes this structure or this institution you to when you believe in yourself it is spirituality i think yeah when it becomes a structuralist religion you i think are you religious can i ask that question you can ask that question i think what if i say yes imagine now yes i am muslim no no no no no no i am not religious i am saying this because i am from spain so it would not make that much sense i think but no no no i am not religious but i am very interested in religions actually whenever i can i have a good friend of mine who is muslim as well and we i talk a lot about muslims islam islam about islam and about christianity and stuff i am very interested in because i am very spiritual i think but 0 religious yeah so what about you have you been baptized or something i am baptized by the way yes i baptized and i did my 1st communion 0 wow i went to cut the case please yeah you are finished again i have had the cases for 2 years 0 wow i sometimes go to church with my grandmother i like go with along her or in christmas 0 that is sweet if my mother wants to go to church i might go to her i actually do not completely dislike going to church huh there is a sort of like not as in the whole religious thing but there is something that is not unnice for me of being in a church i like the calmness that there is inside and i like the voice of the priest there is a priest that is sermonizing and telling you but then there is this priest that has a tone of voice that is a bit transcendental there is something i do not completely dislike about the churches i actually do like a lot entering church i remember i had a big fight about this when i was 16 with my friends in high school they took us to salamanca you and i really wanted to go see the churches and my friends obviously did not want because it is just the age where you are reaffirming yourself and kids are really like against religion sometimes in it and i would struggle because i was not considering myself religious but there was something yeah i do not know if it is because i had an upbringing more near church that i have a different relation to that space i am yeah i remember having a big fight with with this friend because i wanted to go and she was saying like priests rape children you i was like but i was like what you cannot reduce religion to that but i know how to articulate it very well at that time was more of an intuition of why i did like church as a space i also like i am very amazed architectonically with churches generally they are impressive actually the book that i have from rafael moneo  it is about a church that was designed by corbusier 0 really i could have seen interesting yeah yeah yeah it is called rorsec i will send it later on but yeah there is i am amazed about that there is one artist called team hacker you sound artist he did a phd in i think in london and it would be extremely magical that it was in forensics architecture i do not think that it would be but it is like the typical thing that maybe would be done there and he did a phd on noise actually what noise represents i think that the meeting is finishing yeah i am seeing that as well it i am stopped the recording yeah stop the recording and then we can (EDACC-C23_P1)
so what was happening because i am yeah because my family is visiting this weekend but i was a bit i do not know i did not think that it was so hard to get reservations in london for everything 0 wow yeah so yeah it is a bit of a mess because everything was booked and i only find things for very late at night and they are a bit like pissed they are not pissed they are okay but they are like a bit like you are a mess they are a little bit annoyed or anxious okay and it will be fine it will be fine yeah which places are you planning to go for a thing so yes my father likes to go shopping anything you i do not think he likes the obviously you should call me that so i am not stopping anything yeah those are his hobbies so now i left him with his girlfriend to go and shop this morning and they can go shopping together good and then i will eat them for the eating part here is your ice drinking cocktails really i feel like it is really good yes a lot he likes i have a couple of cocktail bars in london that is good because i only know one that i went to that i really like but if you have a list maybe it is nice i can share it with you he actually took a picture of me yesterday i can send it to you drinking a cocktail with him wow okay which cocktail did you order and so the 1st time we were having cocktails i had a vodka tonic cheers has luchi martinis let us see what you have you i remember that those are simple ones i do not like cocktails actually i think they are too do you know that alex our friend is special in cocktail making i do not know i find cocktails generally are a bit too sweet yeah i do not like the sweetness of cocktails i do like them for example i do like spritz or when it is aperol and like this when it is a bit more bitter  but i am also quite for example i like both catonic a lot it is more dry maybe it is not that sweet thanks pam yeah i usually order whiskey it is not because i am living in an improv but because i do not know there is this thing of the colors and stuff i find it kitsch or not kitsch but i do not know like yeah i know what you mean generally me too i am not a big fan it is not my thing but some people really like them like this fanciness of like 0 yeah no yeah i think my father likes them because he cannot walk a lot and and immediately it was out of conversation that is why he likes cocktails can we sit and talk kind of the same and they are fancy and they are fancy and he likes things that are fancy okay yeah yeah i am going today to a very nice cocktail place actually i am talking about cocktail places with ana marie who is a friend of my father who is like 70 or something wait when he said thank you it is called tandem and i will hold it have you ever been okay you used to go with your father he would like it for sure i am certain that is one of these places that you know that is where the right opinion yes he likes those yeah so it is the same thing but very hidden actually it is more hidden it is like to be like boadas is extremely this is where in barcelona that is extremely populated usually and because it is very famous and it is very hard to find and also there is dain martini dain martini is the same thing very populated and also there is a lot of nightlife people i would say i do not know how to say that like clerics of the night like clerics of the night but a 60 year old cleric of the night without the money which is the type of clerics of the night that we do not like i think well they were just i do not like they pay for your cocktails what i was about to say is like there is a clear age difference between boys and girls you and for me it is something i am not very happy yeah because i cannot avoid to observe that but anyway there is tandem and tandem is interesting because i think it is in balmes or some of these streets that is extremely crowded and you go to these oases and it is super old i think in scotland they call it old man pub but very clean like everyone is suited up  yeah i do not know i like it and i am meeting there with a friend of my father today that is nice for a cocktail because i was talking with her i mean she is wait 12nd i need to get the charger of the computer yeah yeah no worries take your time does not work very well the image the picture was amazing actually you looked great you so yeah i am meeting ana mari today and she is very this is a friend of my father bye and yeah it is interesting actually it is a 70 year old woman that she always helps me and she is an eye cleric i think as well that is a good one we are my church as well used to be and she is like this proponent like do not get engaged with anyone like try to be by yourself all your life and but this time i am convinced that i will convince her that that is not the case for me anymore i think that is good tell me about it after see how it goes i will i will i will maybe she convinces you otherwise no no no that will not happen but it is interesting because she is like yeah you have to enjoy life as much as possible somehow you i believe that enjoyment is not an opposite to commitment but yeah yeah yeah yeah i also i understand thank you people do not feel like that but that are out there and it is a different period of time i think yeah definitely and especially for a woman especially for a woman exactly but it is very interesting actually i used to smoke my 1st cigarette with her it is like this typical person who was like thank you yeah bit of it is like you are diverting me a little bit so we used to go by car like go to like in a village in my village that there is an abandoned ski resort  and we used to go there by car she was teaching me how to drive by car and when we arrived there it is like okay now we will smoke cigarettes and smoke cigarettes so how old were you maybe 16 or something i do not know i could not drive i could not smoke like it was really i am it was i remember i wanted to go with moto and it took me a long time to convince my mother but then i did not know how to go with moto because i never learned how to go with bicycle when i was a child yeah i remember that so i actually when i wanted to start going with monta i did not know how to do it and then ferran that is a friend of my brother would teach me thank you with his motto but i would throw his motto to the floor so many times wow lulia that was good bye like 0 my god i cannot teach that child so yeah then i dropped the idea and decided i was going to learn to go with bicycle well  one day maybe so you cannot be a motomemi i can not believe i am a tomato but you are a motocopie i can be a little bit what i wanted to say i wanted to say something about yeah that it happens the same thing to me with swimming actually i learned how to swim very very very old actually when i was 16 0 wow no no more more more a 18 or something but when you were a child you did not go into the water yeah yeah yeah but i could swim like maybe like doing the frog style swim like you could hold yourself in water i could hold myself in water and i enjoyed going to water but i could not swim properly and now after some time i start like swimming properly and now everyone tells me that i swim very well actually in yeah because i have been like with other people like trying to yeah you but doing crawl you know like the end i am a good swimmer i always swim a lot when i was growing up i am yeah it was to swimming class every week i remember that in barcelona you used to swim actually yeah yeah i miss it here i think now that it is summer and there is some lidos that i might go to and with these leaders lido is a swimming pool that is how they call it here when it is like a public swimming pool they call it the lido it is interesting when i ask you for a word you always say the word 1st you go on yeah but yeah there is some here that are outdoors but in winter because there is some that are indoors but they are a bit too crowded there is one in peckham but it is full of children and old people and there is no space to swim at all children and old people look like it will be full of pee eh i do not know my flatmate said that he once went to swim and then had like a very bad diarrhea for 3 days hello got in the swimming pool 0 no i like outdoors swimming pools more than indoors  i had one in barcelona that was like a 50 meter out there swimming 0 wow yeah but there was there was hospitalet yeah it did not sound like okay and the water is warm but it is outdoor and so amazing to because in barcelona like it is cold in winter they also have like an indoor one that is smaller 25 meters but in barcelona like if you have a sunny day in winter you can go to the outdoor swimming pool it is not that bad and i liked that it being cold when getting out that was like for me one of the good moments of the week 0 yeah that is a good analogy actually yeah because people think a lot of how many swimming pools laps labs they are doing but they generally i do it as i structure it i i say okay i will do i think i did 16 crawl then 4 of i do not know what it is called thunk yeah from frog style do you do other styles like like like butterfly beautiful good butterfly yeah yeah but not much i feel a bit 0 messy when i do butterfly yeah yeah whatever that is you have to take me and when whenever you arrive to the end of the lab you do the turnaround no no okay but i really enjoy it and i really miss it here i think it is a very complete sport yeah yeah yeah i used to do it a lot actually it was like when i was climbing a lot i used to do it like every 3 days as well so it is good for the body good for me rick and it is good for us as well really give you what i say yeah it does it takes years yeah because you do make a lot of strength with your legs  i think it really stretches a lot of the muscles you know what i used to do with my mother when we were in la scala there were some periods of time like magically i do not know that my mother and i stayed in la scala together for one month or something thank you and it was usually when i because while climbing i broke my ankle i mean that is a very hard story i was in zillertal that is a valley in austria and when i was climbing i because i was with professional climbers okay here is when i started learning that something was a little bit funny and because everyone was climbing super fast i decided to skip some secure points while climbing you and i settled down 0 no and then yeah it was pathetic i think i had to put my feet because i was feeling like i did a lot of of yeah because i did not have a good point so the fell down was very hard i am glad we are together yeah yeah yeah yeah now i will have these mistakes again so i broke my ankle and then i went to la scala to recover for a month and and i remember that my mother used to tell me you have to walk in the sun and even the physiotherapist recommended me that because that way your ankle is like the sun is interesting because it makes your feet to put in all kinds of position in a very soft way let us say and yeah what i was doing is to swim in the sea but because i am very scared to go very very deep in the sea i was doing like yeah like following the course line i was following the coastline of la scala it was very nice it was not a swimming pool but it was almost a swimming pool yeah i like a lot i am swimming in the sea as well in summer and yeah i do that as well i take the glasses and i go yeah i really enjoy swimming if we need summer and we have to swim in turkey 0 yeah that is true go to the seaside and one thing that i would like to try at some point i do not know when and if i could be able to but there is this faces mask that have a yeah yeah yeah be super cool no i think with the because you do not need to like lift up the you can just yeah we like that yeah yeah we have 4 more minutes do you want to talk about something else that maybe sure what was in the list that we have not covered so yeah i do not know i think that we covered so what is your favorite thing about edinburgh this is the last thing i think everything about does not work i do not know sorry that is not a very good answer no it is okay because i do not know edinburgh so much i think my favorite thing well i really like the park that is there is a tree that my friend calls albert i really like that that is my favorite thing that tree that is true yeah it is my favorite thing too we are connected better yeah what a coincidence yeah for me it is the people i think i have been thinking a lot about it and the city is beautiful the weather is horrible but i think that the best thing of edinburgh is the people and all the communities are great around pubs and how you meet them and i think it is something that it becomes with the weather so people have to create more community because there is less things to do  but it is nice that people get in the bar in the pub and they are extremely open and friendly and they are always open to meet new people they like to thank you to create new links all the time  and it is something that it is amazing for me yeah that is nice what is your favorite thing about london 0 that is interesting yeah i like peckham a lot i think and i still start thinking about why but i think that i have this image of london of not being a neighborhood i used to not like it at all because i remember the city and i do not know like this thing of going to a bar and thank you and that was weird you know yeah even i was feeling a little bit but when we were in pecum i think this although it did not happen that someone sit next to us i remember that people used to say hello in the streets thanks for watching so it was not edinburgh but it was something close i think and finding this type of neighborhood like i think in london i think it was very nice so i would say that peckham is one of the things that i like i think that in hackney it did not happen that much but yeah i do not know i like this thing of finding neighborhoods and it is very correlated with the wealth of the people of the place i think and and these things get created and i tend to like them a lot more than  yeah okay i think that we are done we can we can finish bye night nice conversation nice conversation (EDACC-C23_P2)
i think it is recording now you hi my participant number is c 51 p one well hello c 51 p one my participant number is c 51 p 2 nice to meet you i will read the passage now go for it please call stella ask her to bring these things with her from the store 6 spoons of fresh snow peas 5 thick slabs of blue cheese and maybe a snack for her brother bob we also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids she can scoop these things into 3 red bags and we will go meet her wednesday at the train station i will repeat it to make sure that we understand please call stella ask her to bring these things with her from the store 6 spoons of fresh snow peas 5 big slabs of blue cheese and maybe a snack for her brother bob we also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids she can scoop these things into 3 red bags and we will go meet her wednesday at the train station perfect yeah out of all of those things i think red bugs would be actually quite difficult to get you also thank you spoons of snow peas it is like measuring butter in cups it looks like all these words are just selected to actually test some person it is like a brown fox jumping you know like yeah curly covers a lot of phonetic phenomena yeah or maybe cover some of the latino mergers stuff like that  please identify your dialect i would hope so that could be fun yes you so we need to talk about our trip that is what yes upcoming okay so i have not actually looked into it other than looking at the car rental i mean i think so i think it would be good if you like make some you know a tiny bit of progress because my friend is just she likes planning things in advance and then thanks for giving me the time she is unlike many other people in terms of planning yes yeah i like it was strange for me to hire a car so far in advance thank you but also if she is willing to do it that is fine because i do not want to put it on my credit card for 2 months yeah i think we can just ask her to do it i am sure she will be fine with that so we just need to figure out maybe how many drivers she wants to add and what is the price difference but i guess the thing you could do is just to send her the link and  maybe to suggest which car you think is the best yeah what size yeah yeah it is a shame that it is so unpredictable if they are going to upgrade your knowledge you because quite often they do and then the cars are super great and the price differences are actually pretty large well i guess for one day or for 2 days it is one thing but i think we will probably have to not for a week we will probably have to do it yeah it is unlikely that we get them great for a week if we actually do not book that that is true yeah no you make the point i never rented a car for this one before yeah i do not know maybe 1st we are going to make friends with a car okay nevermind but i guess the question is do you want to be a driver or would you rather like 2 of them be drivers or something else i do not know or you do not care absolutely i do not care i do not know how good how well they drive my friend drives pretty well i think she grew up in some mountain area which is yeah 0 then that is perfect yeah i am totally fine with driving and i have driven in scotland before so i am comfortable with that i am not the best driver ever yeah yeah i do not know what you are talking about this one time i drove a van at night with no lights you know what no lie i think so i think i had no lie 0 i do not know that you know yes just walk along yes and and that time i am i like driving i would be actually yes i would prefer yeah i want to be a driver because if it is really bad really bad with nausea okay i want to be able to drive okay maybe just me i mentioned all that in the beginning yeah i will tell her so that will be probably set and we need to develop the route i mean honestly it is mostly just on us right because they do not know almost everything so good anything that is called things i know i have not had time to check what exactly i want to do but i think there are some good hikes in the north i think the more we spend time in the north the better it is for me sorry i just wanted to access the sheet google sheets that they shared right yeah okay let us do that i do not i get texas too and access to that now you do okay that is great no i do not i do not 0 okay let me see if i can share this with you otherwise i am afraid we will have to ask our friends otherwise it is fine i just so what i wanted to know now is exactly how many days we were planning and was it leaving in the morning on the 1st day and stuff like that yes you so i think they are arriving on 14th august in the i do not know midday or evening so they will sleep here one night and then we can leave anytime in the morning 15 everything okay and and so it is going to be 15 16 17 18 19 and then 20 it says drive to edinburgh via loch ness i am not sure why okay so 5 full days it seems so 5 full days and i think yeah 12345 wait 6 nights or what yeah i think 6 nights well because they were counting the nights in edinburgh i believe 0 yes right so it is 5 nights camping so we can get back in the morning on the last day which is august 20th good okay you let us look at the map yeah the question is like do you have do you already know of any places that you want to see or do we like start from distilleries i think we start from the distilleries okay it is like we are up into albany without this story it could be cool wait but it is not on the map is it no it is not okay so the map is yes i will explain that the map is very sparse because the definition of independent distillery is super strict  there is a lot of distilleries in scotland that are owned by large companies but they are like essentially they were just bought by somebody but are operated in the same way they used to be thank you so they are part of a sort of large company but it did not really change the feel of the place so it is still interesting to visit and i think albon is one of those and so is the one on skye talisker yeah but so wait if we get to drive to oban then we do not get to pass glencovely no we know not necessarily will pass next to it so we could like try and back if we want to good to go because if we go north from albany well you know if you look at the map we will pass glencoe almost yes but i do not mind how many of you think we should do 2 of the stories i guess 2 or 3 i do not know for 5 days i mean i am sure they would be happy to do 3 i do not feel like i need to do 3 but i am okay unless they are super expensive yeah i will be fine with 2 so the thing is like i really want to go i think i am interested in going to like northwest scotland yes because i have never been but there is no distilleries so we need to sort of catch them on the way wait wait wait so there are no distilleries whatsoever or or just like no independent ones or no interesting ones stories i will just send you a general map of scotland with the stories there you go it seems to essentially like end on sky okay that makes sense and then there is a bunch in the east but i wonder why so how long is the drive from sky to ula pul i will let that ask google sky to ullapool you well it is not too bad it is like it says 2 hours 27 minutes from the middle of sky 0 excellent so yeah just about 2 hours from the bridge cool so we do not need to plant that long together yeah maybe we can just spend there one night and even that is going to be fine or you know one.5 days yeah so like we could get there and do some hiking and either stay the night or like  move somewhere else in the evening yeah that sounds good  okay in that case we should at some point look for some hikes over there to know where exactly we would like to go yeah that is the i think that would be the best area for hiking maybe plus sky obviously huh i really like the idea of maybe we could take a picturesque road back because there is this road you know like on those fjordy cliffs yeah slightly west from liverpool great so maybe i am sure it is going to be longer but i would like to see those views i think so i am actually curious what if you like drive there on the main like if you want to get to ulaipur probably the most direct way is just to drive you know via inverness and it might save us you quite some time would it make sense or not we drove directly from edinburgh in there yes i mean it does make sense but it would mean that we spend like most of one day in a car 0 well we do not need to drive directly there we can stop after inverness for example or i do not know whatever is there thank you or like campus but yes you know that is tempting actually 0 man we could contact loch ness and then i think somebody wanted to stay there or see loch ness they wanted to see it at least once i think so that is not bad we could do a day at loch ness the 1st day and i am sure there is some hiking to be done so and the camping there is really nice yeah so i guess the question is what would be better to drive because it is obviously easier to drive on the main road right thank you it would save us some time so do we want to save time in the beginning or on the way back because we can also do the reverse well i think i like it i like it more because it is like at 1st it is the places i know thank you but they have not been to so it is exciting and fun you but then the end of the trip is the beautiful things i have not seen yet and i am more excited about it and i want to remember it more okay yeah that i am happy to do that i am into that idea right okay so how long would the drive from edinburgh to inverness be yeah that is probably like pretty fast actually right it is like 3 hours for your 1st so and then we can turn left to loch ness and like yeah 3 hours like 3.5 to get somewhere where we can come you to a nice place for camping yeah yeah we can even get to the place you know where we so during your own that is very good our canumias fortunes i really enjoyed that great it is all right that is a good option so we will be there like you know early afternoon yes so one i will take notes what needs to happen for planning one of the things is what to do at love meals well i think i actually think then that we will have to stay to get into one of the distilleries there no because that path is actually full of distilleries 0 yeah good point so we can get some booze on the way the driver will have to wait for a bit but i hope they will not mind the space side but space side is usually closed you for guests there is i think i have never been there in bit low fee okay so space is actually closed i see or it is hardly ever open for visitors yeah i mean i am happy to do whatever you say but there is also a little bit of a detour a little bit of the source comment tool yeah and then roma that would be cool ben romack is it 0 it is kind of 0 and the coast okay up north on the coast thank you like a little bit east from inverness yes i see well you that sounds pretty nice okay can we do that easily or is it like a big detour it is not a big detour because it is on the main road yeah it is actually there is actually even a path from you know aria more to that 0 yes so in fact we are just like half an hour to tour right okay so perfectly fine the days are so long so we can do that we can just like drive to the distillery which means we are almost there right so from there you to inverness and to the camping place is really easy yes so we can slowly get there even if we get a car much later than we planned for whatever circumstances you because it is a relatively easy drive and we already see a lot and we can even like plan another stop on the way just you know to show them something if we want for example to do something in even in cangram or whatever around the cangram we could sell somewhere yeah well nothing i do not know not necessarily maybe entering there because if it is which day is it going to be sunday of small a lot of small heights small walks in the current gardens that are designed to show you waterfalls or yeah so maybe we can plan something like that and then we get to distillery and then we drive to inverness and to loch lomond and just camp there yeah that will be day one cool i am just checking if they have tours they have a variety of tours thank you one of them lasts 2 hours and costs 75 quid everyone that lasts less and costs less there is an hour and a half for £25 and an hour for £10 okay well we will decide 0 i think the cheap one they do not actually do a tasting they do not do a tasting it is like the £251 yeah would it be available can we already see the dates that they are open or not no you need to send a request which i will do okay yeah that is fine so you know that they that would be the for 15 right yeah 15 what would be a reasonable time well let us say we are not doing it very hard core so we pick up the card 9 yeah getting there from edinburgh is like 3.5 hours let us say yes so i guess we would need if you still want to stop then we probably need at least 5 hours of course yeah i would even say like 6 so if you can book it for like 3 or 4 yeah yeah maybe 4 is even better basically it is like as possible i think i think 3 p m is their latest time okay thank you yeah we can do 3 then if 4 people sent okay we will see what they say is there anything to see in that area actually because i do not know scotland you know north of cairngorms dad i do not know i have never been there i guess the coastal area is not particularly fun because it is usually plain right so maybe not nothing to see there well that depends because i have been to the 3 nice forests and those are the cold thank you but up there walk highlands let us see what did they say i mean i guess we do not have to do it like right now okay just we can we can do like a couple of we can spend a couple more hours around that area if we want to because i think even if you have a tour at like 4 i do not know 3 days i mean the day ends at 11 yeah by 5 well actually no it is going to be august 0 yeah good point good so it is not going to be 11 but i think it is going to be 11 stay with me but still enough time probably to have a couple hours extra yeah  so we have a rudimentary plan we go to the soria we want to camp at loch ness we will find something to hike to walk bye whether it is more on the coast or more around both mass yes but that depends on what we feel like and then from there we should probably head to ula pul area now because that is we do not have time to lose in the familiar grounds okay so that is day 2 so we probably go from yeah it seems like a short drive from like something like what doris or whatever it is called to pool we have 2 hours yeah even less like 124  i mean we can put more but it is fine yeah it is nice to plan for longer yeah and then we do not so we do not need a distillery for that day  so we just probably do a proper whiskey that we can buy at the distillery shops because we have a car most often when i go to the distillery it is like hiking or you know carrying it in the backpack being on the train yeah just the possibilities are endless i have not thought about it before so i would say we leave relatively early from loch ness get to lopu and do a proper hike maybe that day because we will not be tired yet and the 1st day will be mostly driving and being lazy yes i agree that sounds like a good proper hyping which we will need to research yeah i mean there are probably many places around that area i would be surprised a lot of it looks like it is either marshy or really well let us see no i might be very wrong actually no it is just mountains it is full of mountains hills one should say yeah and i think actually there are some pretty good one of the most beautiful mangroves are there it is like when i think at some point i looked up some something like you know 5 or 10 best hikes in scotland and usually there are a couple around that area and there might be also some very nice beaches as well so maybe we can also get there might be yeah they also might be not beaches no beaches whatsoever because it is like this cliff cliffy kind of end of scotland  anyway that this the plan for a 2nd day i guess the question is so do we need to look for a place there to sleep 0 right so how many nights do we want to book the sleeping for one no i do not have any preference i will be fine with one there we go i do not think they find camping the whole week but they wanted to book something yeah i think they want to yeah my take would be probably let us just plan around places we want to see huh and where we want to hike and then check in which of those places there is some like bed and breakfast or something available because i am sure not all of them will be having yep and then we just you know sleep in a normal place but those days yeah i think so i actually think this night might be good because we will be like pretty tired after the hike and also that area like maybe not the kind of place where all the tourists go i do not know yeah because all the tools we have a car so we can actually like drive to some town nearby yeah yeah yeah to reach the foundation i do not think they are like proper towns of settlements villages how i can not read english more than scottish i do not know there are hamlets around around pentland so i am not sure but maybe they are 0 yeah i searched hamlet and wikipedia just shows me the tragedy of hamlet prince of denmark this one what a surprise is not the context so clear i thought my computer is listening to me all the time yeah i am sure just pretending no no i do not know what you are talking about and in fact it is already designed a trip for us it just does not want to give it away you will see whiskey ads all over the place for the next 15 years that will be pretty normal there is a scottish term called clachan not surprised may be preferred to the term hamlet it is a small settlement or hamlet on the island of ireland the isle of man in scotland quachen i will try to think of a name okay we will find a clock and sleep there  do we have i guess so my problem is that i feel like i do not know that area so maybe there are very amazing things to do around ula pul and that area but of course the sky is also wonderful so i feel like i do not have enough data to make a decision about leaving ula pul that night or staying for another day yeah i do not know what is the 3rd one northwest gulf i am actually so what if we start from the end now okay so let us say like the very final day we will be just driving to edinburgh because one of them has a flight i think in the early afternoon yes but that was sorry i think the flight is the early afternoon of the 21st like if you wanted to push it as long as possible we would need to be back like by noon on the 21st but we could also just come back by 20th are you sure because i think 21st is 0 no it is sunday yeah i am like 90% sure do you have anything in the group let me see because the that sounds crucial i think we just talked about it maybe there was something before you joined let me see  yeah it is a bit confusing no i am afraid not i have to ask well that makes it kind of difficult to plan in advance because the last line in the spreadsheet just says drive to edinburgh via loch ness and that is day 7 so and day 1st includes arriving to edinburgh right let us like i would probably feel safer just planning on coming home to previous night one side i am not flying but like one pm yeah i just like i do not know if they want to stay in edinburgh because it might be also like they do not have where to stay i mean i can i can maybe host them but i do not know if like maybe they prefer to just sleep you know in the in the highlands and then wake up a date and drive up here yeah thank you so we should discuss it next time we talk but in india so i would be happy to give somebody an air mattress as well 0 right you have an air mattress i do because a friend of us was wondering who can provide an air mattress but we will talk about it later okay okay so well so i guess the question is do we need to find a short drive on the morning of the last day or not okay so i think if we wanted to do that have a short drive home on the last day i would probably make it from the trail sex yeah that makes sense right because it is a pretty place to stay yes short grade for sure and it is kind of on the way and with the car you can make it like pretty deep if you want yeah exactly to some actually nice place 0 my god we could even go to this restaurant the one which you huh my birthday restaurant so it was so good 0 that is one yeah it was fun i liked it a lot i do not even remember where it was it was kind of a bit out of the way no i mean depends what is on your own it was you know on one of those logs i have it on the map i think do you remember the name or something in the birth i n b e r  it is on i mean everything in scotland is called inver i think in the restaurant is rooms okay next to a town called yes yes scared me thank you kari what 0 yes okay on the law 0 yeah this name i can not find anymore it is not too bad very it is not too bad i mean from the main way bye 40 minute drive yeah and if we wanted to have fun we could even take a ferry from sort of like across los lom i believe you know going back to glasgow anyway yeah i think i do not know i do not know how i feel about like waiting for fairies that is less predictable i think 0 yeah especially for my heart okay yes you that is fine so let us say that it is an option for last night yeah just like some somewhere on a small block in there thank you maybe this time with fresh water i do not know what you are referring to i just heard that whiskey goes better with fresh water than salty water i think it goes perfectly with slightly salty water let us just come to the personal boils down to personal preferences i do not criticize your taste in any way it just boils down to a handful of salt that is a very reasonable comment cool so ok being in the trostex then could be a last night thing yep so if you wanted to do that we could probably also just like or right there in the morning do some high of dinner yeah and try com i mean actually i do not know we do not need to do a hike like in drosics i do not feel the need to do that because you know to drosics we can get any time that is true if you have an extra day i would rather spend it in glencoe got this very correct i think if you do a hike that day i would actually rather do it in glen quarry no good point okay so there is this one this clearing on the west coast which is called ardnamurhem of course it is now we also will get cold if you look at the map that is literally what came to my mind on the tip of my tongue yeah it is out of the way i mean yes but also do we really care about which is fine interesting so it just might take long to get there from anywhere else yeah so so it is terrible actually i see we would need to from fort william i guess that is how you get there no you unless you take a ferry from sky which would save us some time i think there is some fairies from skype in there very very to malay right  and then you can drive more easily rather than from fort william that could be fun it would be a scottish fairy experience yeah and that would also give us extra like we do not need to carry on that day maybe so we can actually afford doing a ferry and it is relatively short one and not on a day when we are in a rush yeah okay that is good that is good so let us see i have something on sky i have something marked from the previous trip it is like the end of that long bit where the ferry departs from it says sandy beach which is 0 interesting interesting and we actually have not checked out this park i think we have i actually have not because it was a bit too far out of the way yeah so that is a good call cool i am glad about that so it is a short drive actually from the ferry place it is only an hour and a half to the necessary okay so that will be approximately each day i am confused already i know because i heard it from the other side ok now i am thinking from this the theory will probably be going these words to the 12th sex yes and maybe do a hike around glencoe valley no yes because we need to drive through glencoe yeah so that actually sounds very good  okay so i guess the last day could be drive to glencoe hike drive to the trawlfix stay there yep okay so which means that the story could be the day before that and we stay somewhere there and then move to glencoe in the morning yes okay and making notes of it will make it clear yes so if they depart on day n this is going to be on day n 2 yes perfect and 2 yeah i need to figure out when they are actually leaving because that is the most the most important bit that we are missing now okay so the previous day we need to finish by being at the the story and it is probably important for me to check it what times to take the tours yes so again this coltland is green as the celery okay we will be in the scotland is greenest distillery hopefully and the day before that we will just be on sky probably okay monday through friday the last one is at 4 p m okay that is it i think that matches thank you yeah so we want to get there for 4 it takes hour and a half driving however much the ferry is taking do we need to book the ferry or not i will have to check because i do not know yeah okay and it depends on the ferry not both of them are the same yeah so i feel like the rest is like the rest would be pretty easy we just need to figure out what like whether we want to stay longer on sky or in the ula pool area because that is what they are going to explore anyways right so we will probably have half a day that day on skye  morning and early afternoon before we have to take the ferry yes so if that is like a beach day that could be perfect because we do not need that much time to hang out on the beach yeah and i mean i do not like i do not know if you have too much time right because if you need to be there at 4 it is like how much is it drive like an hour maybe and now we are good an hour plus probably like half an hour to an hour by ferry and all the medicine the queues yeah so we have the morning and like a little bit of yeah one pm to 2 pm thank you so it could be a nice morning on the sandy beach and if we want to explore more in the sky that would be the previous thing yep so that day is something chill in the morning and then driving and then we all need to find something to do after the story i mean after the distillery it is like again we can something to do as in like a pretty place to come or yeah yeah yeah somewhere for a walk or something interesting but but i think that would be a pretty generally it will be a chill day right how are we doing on time by the way 0 we are like 40 minutes in okay i do not know should they continue the same way just without stopping and then they can cut the recording wherever they want if they want i think so we are done they want more data i do not envy those people who are going to do transcripts about scottish i know tiny tiny school of places which they really do not know about trophy and we probably pronounced them wrong it is going just to be a lot of placeholders all over the place cool so then we have this day on which we either do something up north and then head to skye in the afternoon and just camp and hang out there in the next morning or we go to skye immediately and then have a day in skye so i am confused how many days we have the 21st days plan and there is one in between is it one or 2 that is what i do not remember anymore that depends yeah exactly maybe it is true so it is relatively easy to fill 2 days in sky and ula pul i am sure yeah there is so much in sky so i guess it is if you want you could even do the story in sky or go to a basset yeah if we have 2 days i would say we can also do like telescope probably no yeah and i do not know hike on sky as well i also think that probably our hikes will have to be adjusted based on the weather and so on because if it rains all day then we cannot do hike obviously that day thank you so i do not know i would actually say let us figure out when they are departing for sure and write a preliminary plan that you seem to have noted in the thank you in your notes and then we check like both of us and maybe them too if there is something particular that we actually want to see either in ula pul or on sky  and then yeah thank you excited about those 2 last days i am kind of hopeful actually also of the region between polar pole and skye yeah kind of what i missed hopeful hopeful yeah it looks topologically very interesting yeah that is what i am saying when i say ula pul i mean the whole west coast maybe there is something that we can just see or climb or slip in that is the whole of scotland places to see and climb that is what it is for so i think we have like the core basically and now we just need to i think so too i will send him the link for the car rental and say that i would like to drive yeah and then we can clarify about the last day accordingly so i think you can just click to request the access to that yeah she designed and just create a new one

she can scoop these things into 3 red bags and we will go meet her wednesday at the train station please call stella ask her to bring these things with her from the store 6 spoons of fresh snow peas 5 big slabs of blue cheese and maybe a snack for her brother bob we also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids she can scoop these things into 3 red bags and we will go meet her wednesday at the train station okay great speaking about train stations thank you where do you want to spend your summer holiday yeah you are yeah it is a summer holiday yeah so i think we will go to the uk right finally yeah yeah to the southwest in cornwall it is a good opportunity to do some sailing actually i think it is historically a place where sailing has been very popular you and it is one of the places where they are still preserving all the tall ships actually they have a big tradition yeah i mean yeah and it is quite difficult to find tall ships in eastern europe for instance so you actually have to travel quite long distances in order to have this sort of experience so that is why i am pretty excited about this holiday i am a little bit afraid about serious business yes the thickness and the waves and that windy atmosphere you know yeah but actually i mean the windy atmosphere should be okay in my experience at least it relaxes you and it takes your mind off other things which you may usually be worried about such as daily life or whatever i but seasickness the best thing is to eat you take some pills take them maybe one day before at least and maybe keep taking them if you feel like it but at some point your body will get used to the sea and you will not feel it so bad actually there are people who are kind of hooked on sea sickness because it also makes you a bit dreamy and drowsy you so it is a bit like being high you know so it is a very bad idea to go unsure yeah actually there is such a thing as being land sick atlantic yeah yeah i read it in those sailing books you i mean like when we were kids and we were reading about i do not know 0 neill or dickens or something something i have done bye and they wrote about this yeah because they were they had to get when they were ashore they had to get drunk in order to not get so land seeking yeah that is fine i mean i have spent a few days at sea and when you come back at least when you go to sleep or you are lying down you it feels like everything is moving with you and i am not sure if it is a nice or not it is somewhere in between i mean you kind of like it but at the same time you would like it to stop it is a bit weird weird 0 my god yeah and it goes on for at least one day after you go back but then i guess you will see you will have your own experience of being glensick lensick i am afraid of being seasick yeah 1st of all and then you yeah hopefully we will have good weather and then it will be easier yeah i did not look on the forecast weather forecast yeah i have not either but i mean i would check it in the week of our yeah  it is twirling when we leave yeah because otherwise it might change anyway we would be quite close to the coast i guess so it is not such a big risk that can captain can take some decisions some courses in order to avoid us being too exposed yeah yeah than wind well it is a sort of introductory trip you know so it should be soft on you so in my mind there are all these images and scenes from i do not know movies like that one i have watched utrecht you know yeah the last kingdom kingdom the last kingdom yeah yeah and those viking girls you know sailing the seas but you are not going to get it i do not know to what extent viking girls were sailing the seas i think they were tending to babies at home rather than sailing actually i have been to a museum in sweden and yeah the great majority did that they were  just women but there were some warrior girls you know very good and they fought just like amen yeah that is life i imagine them to be very big you know yeah of course and not get killed in your 1st battle i mean they are all big right nordic people 0 my god they are huge they are huge i do not know i was looking at them like that like i was 5 years old yeah and his parents it is strange it is important yeah it is funny but i would like to go to some sanctuaries you know to see any more yeah but you know centuries actually hold animals who have been saved such as animals who were in a circus or being abused bye and they were reclaimed somehow or maybe captured by animal police or something like that and put into care of this kind of sanctuary yeah i know they have some sad stories yeah they do in their lives but thank you i think that is a happy thing take care 5 star hotel hotel right something like do you remember the bear sanctuary yeah traumatized bears yeah have i told you that story about my colleague who went to another bear sanctuary and and there was a girl female bear and that came from the circus  and when it was the the the customers were brought with a truck in the sanctuary and they had they were they was they were not walking on foot and and when the bear saw the truck she just stood up on her 2 feet and put her hands you know like in a like you know ballet but you know like in the circus and it was a big huge animal doing so graciously i am so excited period and it was just amazing and the whole crowd of people yeah started to clap their hands so scream and the lady from the sanctuary just said no no no we do not want them to be bears not ballerinas bye it is funny and sad enough yeah yeah but you know it is funny when we were little children we actually liked this because we were kind of primed with i mean families everybody around wanted us to go to circus and thought lord when a bear with would be dancing yeah and all of those tigers i mean it is so humiliating to see such a you huge fascinating animal you know you lifting his paw okay okay it is silly yeah and i remember the lady in the ring putting her head inside the mouth of the lion or the tiger super yeah can i and everybody would talk at least in my family that there once was this accident and the animal actually closed his mouth thank you i mean i do not know maybe there was maybe there was not but it was something to bring a bit of suspense to of course same as with acrobats yeah entropy is the jumps and so on another colleague of mine told me a story it should be true because i think there were in the there was in the newspapers at the time i do not know in the 50s or something there was a training lady that trained the or her life lions thanks and she had those cubs lying cubs and she raised them from cubs to grownups yeah but there was a rule for ladies trainers that they we will be right back they were not allowed to go in the cage with the lions when they were in their period you know bye and because of the smell you know the blood yeah and she raised those cubs since they were i do not know like this and they ate her i am sorry okay they did not the staff of the circus did not manage to save her yeah the best is the best yeah wild animals yeah that is where i stay away from more than once yeah straight dogs so no sorry bye straight lines should not be on the streets yeah they should not be they are cute they are nice but not on the streets yeah but i was thinking to visit that sanctuary with eagles and other huge birds okay yeah sure i mean i i i thought you would be talking about authors there is a lot of waters yeah they are so funny yeah i mean i think that the whole thing with authors is that you do not catch them sleeping which they do all the time basically hey if you can catch them while they are active that is fine but otherwise you know they just float as a deer licked sheep with really no worries and no direction with their tummies up yeah of course but they are spectacular when they hunt or just play bye amazing i think their design is amazing because they can float so without any worries i mean they can simply stay like this and physics do their jobs nature does its job they do not have to worry about anything which is fun yeah you do not even know if they are aware that you are there looking at them they think so i am not sure i mean when i saw them they were just ignoring everybody because they were the stars of the i do not know zoo or where did you see them in several places once we were to ah no actually we were not no but i have seen them in many zoo gardens in various cities in europe and it is the same thing almost every time they just stay there float you know whistles on the other hand whistles are much more active met you know the ones which are sort of tubular and long i know i know but they are on land they do not float yeah they do not vote you actually i once saw an author i think it was in the czech republic in prague i think and it was sort of putting on a show for the visitors it seemed very aware that people were watching you and there was this very large water basin where she could float and everything was like this i mean they even had polar bears which had a huge water basin but the whole wall was transparent and you could see them floating in the water and it was spectacular you can imagine a polar bear huge my god swimming under the water i think it is amazing and you know the polar bears in particular have those very big paws you yeah like men is pores yeah yeah my head yeah doing like this is the one i am going to eat this yeah it is worth seeing and i was talking about the author so it kept taking these dives and showing itself to the visitors but just like proving that she could do it you know she was yeah thank you burning on her sides in the water it was all a demonstration but you use i mean you saw them like in a glass wall yeah exactly like aquarium not wearing yeah but the very i am happy thank you 1st i reimagined the scene from above you know like seeing from a balcony that was interesting you had them at eye level so you had water actually at eye level yeah the animal would go on land on the piece of land it had there the otter and then it would look at the crowd which was there because it was sort of a star you know and then it would go down again bye to its show and then up and again you know watching around yeah looking around but the crowd was i do not know just being loud happy yeah yeah i mean there were a lot of children so you can imagine okay okay i was thinking that the author just heard somehow the vibrations you know and she did it on purpose because she heard that she was taking some applause or something i do not know but yeah it seems to be enjoying actually the whole situation yeah i know you have a water life a zoo water life you know you have fish your meals are secure yeah exactly okay yeah it is nice but do you remember i think we went together at the zoo where there was a little window not so little like a meter wide and a meter this hi and sitting with her back there i think his back i think it was a he there was a huge gorilla the one staying in the window yeah and she had i do not know some silver hair in her fur i do not remember the silver hair but i remember the gorilla my god it was huge yeah and look at you bite your shoulder 0 my god it was ah ah i do not know if it is a memory a true memory or something that someone else told me but there was a guy passing by an athletic and viking kind of looking guy and the gorilla got a little bit mad no what is it i do not know but i know at some point we were in front of the gorilla area and the alpha male came towards us i have he was exactly like the chief of clan you know you like this very nice what is up thank you what are you doing here my territory i was confused you told me the story about a sportsman that yeah it was stupid news it was more like a pr stunt i think about one of the big basketball players or something like that yeah could have been shaquille 0 neal actually who was telling that whenever he goes to zoo he annoys the gorillas because they feel threatened you know thank you that is when the thank you that is what it is actually in that news they had a zoo manager who was prepared to take a call and he confirmed that gorillas react to shaqill okay which is even more of a sign that it was all directed ah okay maybe do you think so i guess so but it is okay i mean they did it well yeah it is funny it is funny to intimidate a gorilla and do you have any idea where do you want to go next after england yeah actually i do i mean of course greece would be nice and it is a good place to sail and all and i would like to do this maybe next year but i would really like to go in a more exotic place such as the southeastern asia maybe thailand or some other country in the area especially if we have enough time to take the trip because you would need i guess 2 days for the trip yeah maybe i would just want another kind of work but yeah i might think differently in the cold season 0 so you would like to take this exciting vacation during i do not know the winter break or something i am not sure usually yeah usually people go to these areas in the cold season  i have once been there in the winter and it was very interesting it was not like going to the tanneries you know where it is still 20 degrees celsius and you can not thank you going to the water so it was complete summer there and so that is a big change and it is nice but we will have to see it also depends on how many leave days i will have because you need the least i would say at least 2 weeks to do this right otherwise it feels rushed because the distance thank you long you need a bit of time to accommodate to the place and and i think yeah we would need to take around 2 weeks but yeah it is possible i mean i would consider this for the winter holiday maybe i think in this kind of countries the monkeys are free bye yeah i think that will be a great opportunity to i do not know be close to to get yourself by monkeys i am sorry no really i would avoid them i mean i have told you before but i really think monkeys are dangerous especially when there are many of them but fortunately the areas with monkeys are usually well known and you only go there if you want to you usually you can be surprised by a monkey yeah if you want to see monkeys we will go there but i will keep a safe distance this time there were some advices that you do not have to carry any food with you yeah in your black bag but yeah i mean this would be the 1st thing you should not do but even a bottle of water i used to have a bottle of water when i went on this hill with monkeys in thailand and they just they wanted the bottle i think it was a small it was a monkey cub at 1st wanted the bottle and i kind of pulled the bottle from its hands which were reaching out towards it awwww yeah funny as it might be it did not feel safe actually and then the adults came because i did not be here and yeah things started to get a bit too tense and i had to leave the area because it was not going to a good end you left the bottle over there no i did not leave the pod yeah i am going to put it in my other bottle hahahaha they are stealing everything but i mean usually they would not be aggressive but you do not want to upset them of course i think they i do not think they want water specifically but i think they wanted the bottle thinking of juice or something i think they have just curious thanks nice i think they are just curious okay because they stole somebody is pack of cigarettes it is not like they smoke you know they just it is not as stole the cigarettes and took it on the roof of a kiosk which was nearby okay play with it for a while and then abandon it there where of course nobody could reach it anymore i think they are too smart for that i think they have a deal with the seller from under the yeah the cash and if they bring cigarettes or something the seller will give them food or bananas monkey business but you know you know in spite of the good advice of not carrying food you could find a lot of monkey food actually at the basis of this hill okay what is that i think it was some kind of nuts that is okay i do not remember exactly monkey food very big bag actually like half a kilo or a kilo because there are many yeah exactly because there are many like having a big dog yeah i remember just now that in venice a 100 years ago or something when i was 0 you are in venice whoa yeah there were some posts that you do not have to feed the pigeons be sure that you there are too many of them yeah because they damaged the sculptures in the buildings and so on i am not but there were everywhere people who sell pigeon food you know bye and you put it into your arm the food and pigeons will come into your hand you know and take a photo and have a memory from venice yeah so how was venice like did you like it i was a seasick because in venice yeah that is an achievement we took we took a boat yeah to reach venice you came by sea yeah yeah yeah we can by see i do not know i do not remember i was okay a teenager i do not remember many details but i am sure that we took a boat and i was already sick when we landed and the little streets and the canals are so very charming and thank you you know the museums and the cathedral that is big thank you actually there was sea water in the cathedral you you know and it was it smells but is it really seawater in the channels in venice yeah i mean it is not sweet water it is the same as it is all the because there was that smell that specific smell you know we will see and in the church the floor was made of stones you know you and the combination between the smell of the stone and with the salt of the water that was so old awesome both of them are so old it was and i had that sickness it was yeah so good you but i what do i remember i remember the statues the pigeons the cafes you know you areas and being sick by the way you are asking about our next holidays maybe we should take a cruise because good many crews in the mediterranean actually also touch on venice yeah and it is a good way to see 4 or 5 destinations in one go that is a good idea but do you think like going on that huge ship that we saw in sweden yeah something like all of them are are huge because that is the more effective way to do it it is possible to also take a smaller ship but if you want you know it depends on your priority if you want to enjoy the sailing thanks you never have any reason to take a big ship but if you want to enjoy the land destinations then that ship is very good at taking you fast and in comfort to those destinations yeah when i see those ships i think of i do not know like agatha christie or something i have my own you think so with the big cruise ships yeah somehow i do not know where i place in my mind the action from the book in one of those big ships i know that in those days they would not look like yeah they look now it is impossible because they are so fit you know the shape of the yeah they are too modern and fit thank you i imagine them to be more more very end yeah and i was i meant to in those days okay but i do not know i think of ballrooms chandeliers and men in tuxedo in the evening yeah of course although you know i have never been on these modern cruise ships but i think they are more like floating balls more than i mean it is just like a big shopping and food courts and of course you also have the entertainment area with swimming pools and whatever so it is a mix of shopping malls and food courts and entertainment but yeah i do not think they resemble a lot to titanic let us say or to you make it sound so romantic so unromantic you yeah like a mall like a floating mall yeah i think the purpose of those ships is to make you feel as little as possible like being on a ship actually yeah comparing to i do not know the ships with those big no namaste or what do you mean i do not know of course they are so different from old ships historical ones but i do not think they are like floating malls and hotels well 1st of all they are huge i mean they are bigger than any building on land you should imagine there are between 3 and 5000 people on one of those ships so it is basically a little city it is a town nice and it usually has 10 14 decks thanks that is like the floors of a building yeah and you most of the time i mean i said i have not been on a cruise ship i have been but only to cross an area not to spend more nights on that ship so i know what it looks like but i have not spent a lot of time there you and all the spaces are done exactly like on land it does not have the signature of a ship is spaces which would be more cramped or feel like you are on a ship as you would on a small boat or on a tall ship everything is done in order for you as a passenger to feel exactly like on land like for instance the foot court which was a whole bridge and it was huge it was i think 200 meters my again it was exactly like the old town of a city where you had the main alley and on the sides there were all sorts of thank you cafes and restaurants he killed the magic i mean they have their use but it is not what you would imagine thank you if you think about older ships yeah but i think in the mediterranean sea they have you know like dolphins i think it is worth yeah there are dolphins everywhere i guess in this area of  climate so so you can see both ends from the mall yeah yeah but you know you would be seeing them from like 50 meters high because the free deck is very high above the water  it is not like seeing them from a boat or a small ship but it is like seeing them from the top of a block of flats yeah that is it is strange a little bit but if you have your room and with those round windows yeah know and you are at the level of the sea yeah probably but i am not sure you want to be there because usually the worst cabins are at the yeah bottom yeah and actually if you have a better category of accommodation it should be higher up actually i think always high always yes that stayed the same with titanic i think i was thinking about titanic a little bit yeah the 3rd class you always have the irish people dancing downstairs yeah there was an order over there yeah i think it is okay i mean the thing i like most about these ships is that they are very fast so you go to sleep in venice and you wake up in barcelona at really yeah the 1st yeah wow and they also go more or less in straight lines   because they are so powerful so they do not have to avoid certain no in britain currency definitely not yeah they are you know like a big mammoth yeah and the schedule is like this you get in the morning to your destination you have the whole day or most of it on land and then you board the ship and in the evening or at night it goes to the next destination does not sound so bad yeah you spend the night on the sea and you do not enjoy that much the sea that is your point yeah that is my point but if you want to do a circuit through europe it is much more comfortable than a bus the color so yeah bye yeah advantages of course yeah i think it is nicer and you have the seagulls and the salty air i think there are some advantages i just remember the story i had these children is books or teens books i do not know when i was a little child and there were stories i think they were written by russians actually and translated okay and one of them was about this ship i do not remember exactly what was happening there but i remember at one point there was also an illustration of the ship is captain for fun taking his rifle and shooting at seagulls and from that moment on it stuck in my mind that this is something you do on a ship shoot the seagulls yeah yeah just killing time you know just thank you take a rifle and shoot at seagulls 0 my god those russian authors i am and they also have the drawing i imagine you know yes yes it was a hand drawn it was very suggestive thanks actually that is the thing the drawing the images yeah actually those books i had as a little child they had very good illustration that i think of them they were i think they were so different from nowadays because they will use watercolor you know bye graphics and pencil graphics and so on now you have that adobe illustrator and they all look the same you know if you put it so for me for me because i am another generation snow white from i do not know you 50s on the 50s it is more charming has a lot of you know that specific perfume with that it 2 d graphics you then there is like mickey mouse club you know thank you i do not think you know them do you know them me mickey mouse club hello no they are so too perfect too you do not have anything to relate them to but what kind of graphics is it it is made like in adobe in premiere you so he is so is it 3 d yes 3 d it looks more real somehow but it is you colorful to be real you know but the kids are born with mickey mouse club and they do not know and mickey mouse club means all the disney characters yes yes the like mini mickey i think they have also goofy you know of course it was my that was my favorite yeah it was crazy the way he talked i think i liked all the i liked donald and goofy because you could not understand the words but you understood them you know i never liked goofy he was too sloppy i do not know i like he was it is goofy of course 0 but donald getting mad that was perfect ah it was a show you yeah much better and he got angry and do you remember that he had 3 little duck nephews yeah 0 my yeah it was a full show yeah that was a fun year and i think there were also these cartoons where it was donald and chip and dale ah they were sold yeah 0 my god they were so lovely yeah yes yes i know them chip and dale also that is another one you that is another good memory the way they talk i should listen more to the way they talk you know they squeak yeah yeah i am curious how they did the voiceover i do not think it was made on a computer now they could not have it was the 14th is i do not think there was any processing there yeah 0 all of these cartoons in our childhood they were actually propaganda you know you yeah no they were not they were made in the 40s and if you remember there were a lot about you know fighting there were guns there many times yeah it was not really about nazis maybe but it was about having this fighting attitude i guess be being sort of aggressive which you do not see in later cartoons you i mean yeah you have mischievous characters but not that attitude and you know there is a lot of flag waving go you have a few symbols in tom and jerry and in donald duck as well actually and and popeye the sailor he was actually i think he was a propaganda character he was meant like that i think he was fighting who i mean he was fighting that big guy brown haired guy dark haired guy yeah huge i do not know and fat and but they think that was not i do not know he symbolized russia or something i do not know sure because at that point it was not russia it was everything bad i guess well it was the nazis but russia became a problem later yeah bye the yeah papa was actually older i think he came from the 20s or 30s and he worked i do not know i do not know yeah maybe there was a comic book and i said yeah i think that is how it started  and the same with superheroes and with marvel and dc comics you you know they also came from the 20s and 30s and they had a part of their career was about the war effort more or less fighting the baddies yeah that is and of course we did not treat them like this when we were small we did not get to see the war but it was but it is silly that we have a war right now i mean that is so stupid is it is incredible that we just turned back time and you are in the same point somehow yeah it is and it is affecting us because you have inflation and a few other negative effects so it is not a good thing thank you good just said plus talking about travel i really wanted to go to saint petersburg which is not longer an option of course but i have heard saint petersburg is a very nice city actually and i think russia has very different areas of course because it is huge it is a huge landmass but moscow is supposed to be very different from saint petersburg and very different from other russian cities problems would not want to visit but saint petersburg i heard is really nice yeah they have some you know like big cathedrals or orthodox cathedrals yeah and i think they build in a magnificent way because they are not so so it was an imperial capital yeah they are not so humble there must be some golden roofs there of course some golden roofs some military guys in those shiny uniforms bye we are reading and actually you could do some petersburg and the areas nearby without really traveling throughout russia you could do the baltic the eastern baltic so come on yeah you could go through estonia and saint petersburg you and then maybe finland if you want to go further thank you doors so saint petersburg gets up you know more in the east north of the baltic sea from let us do it if you were in estonia you would go a bit north here  okay moscow is a little bit down you know i think yeah it is a lot and a lot down here yeah yeah i think moscow is a nice touristic city i heard it is very different from russia i mean from normal russia normal russia i think i also think they have all the glamour over there and the rest of russia you i think it is taking it hard yes i am sure about that but i think that is the case with many capitals such as berlin bye not being so german and london not being so representative of england yeah yeah yeah yeah i wanted to say something about moscow but i forgot i heard it is pretty expensive really i mean by national standards at least i do not think it is as expensive as the nordic countries for instance or as london but yeah i guess like any big city you it is different from the prices you would find in the rest of the country i heard that it is very cold i am not so sure maybe it is because it is continental and maybe it is drier actually i think because there is a lot of land around it your butt freezes in 2 seconds come on do you remember your friend from sweden that lived in moscow some years and he is thought that he would not have any problem with the cold in winter because he is from sweden yeah yeah the big surprise yeah maybe in sweden it is milder because it is wet i do not know because i think it is different the sea cold from the continental 0 hold yeah i think it is quite different by the way when i was in thailand and in singapore it felt like you were in a sauna or in a washing machine after it ended you because there was so much water in the air it was saturated really it was very hot but at the same time very wet it was like jungle you feeling it was very strange and there was a very particular smell as well somehow pleasant thank you it was i think it was natural i do not think it was a city smell but it smells like what like sea or like leaves yeah i think it was something vegetal and with  everything was wet the soup was wet i imagine yeah so you were talking about thailand or singapore mostly singapore but it also okay applies to talent okay yeah lots of memories but i saw some pictures with you and with the tiger cub yeah from there yeah those were from thailand i think yeah i will never be sure if those tigers had a good life or maybe they received some sort of drug in order to be so calm and because there were lots of people there i think there were over 100 tourists and they kept coming and going and everybody was batting them you and it is not very cat like you know to be so still and you you know let everybody touch please especially if you are a tiger i guess so they did not seem to be abused in any way they looked very nice their fur was perfect  but i just wonder if it is possible for a tiger to behave like this naturally silly cats you know made of textile yeah so i guess you would like to have this experience anyway i am of being with the tiger cub yes i would love to squish a tiger cup i think you know the little ones are like dog size they are pretty big it comes yeah of course yeah of course you know like a big dog yes of course they are you know felines big stuff yeah yeah big kids big cat that is the name thank you i i think in 5 minutes we should be okay yeah so that was about our future vacation and love of nation yeah it is always a nice topic to talk about it is lovely especially now that it is warm outside it really feels like going on a holiday yeah have a martini and go on a holiday although it is pretty rainy here and it is good i expected it to be much hotter by this time sticky too sunny too sticky yeah exactly no no it is okay it is okay i think this rainy weather would last a little bit more and then we have our furnace like usual yes and then when the furnace comes we should go to 25 degrees in england thank you yeah i think so yeah but the water is pretty cold so i am sorry for you but i do not think you would be able to swim in the sea it is okay i do not want to swim in the ocean without the dolphin friends yeah i went once in i did not go in an ocean but in i do not know i think it was the mediterranean but but i did not get the balls to go without a life saving jacket huh because the water was so deep and the guy you know the captain of that little little boat who took us bye deep in the sea told us 0 there are i do not know 100s of meters of deep deep waters yes you know you cannot see the shore because we are in a volcano area you know like in a scoops yeah area of the does not matter so much if it is over 2 meters you it is the same 2 or 100s you can drown happily but i do the same actually even when sailing and when we were anchored in a bay  i always had my life jacket with me that is it i mean not really always the only way i would not go with a life jacket was if i had my snorkeling mask on yeah because it bothers you if you also have a life jacket it kind of floats you up and you can not it is you can not go a bit down you to look at head or yeah yeah yeah yeah and that was really nice actually because the water was very clear in those areas it was increased and you could swim around the boat and also inspect its keel and the anchor chain and so also like a safety check besides just looking at nature yeah but mediterranean is not so salty is it i mean it is actually it kept you up yeah yeah yeah it does i am it keeps you up and if you have that mask it does not matter so much anyway because as long as the tube is above water you are fine and yeah if you are in a bay there are big waves and the tube should have a mechanism which does not let water get in yeah it blows it out yeah i think it closes it if there is any water yeah then you can blow it outside yeah yeah yeah i love snorkeling it is such a sensation of seeing those little colored fishes thank you fish and but the sensation of freedom i think you it is great it is yes and i had the sensation in the balloon in the air balloon but balloon and but it is different it is different it is not the same but it is a sense of you know bye letting go it feels very nice i really hope you will feel like this with sailing as well because it is not so far from being in a balloon it is just longer and you get this bye but otherwise it is pretty similar and it is not so long and you know where you land you know the port is fixed yeah yeah that is an important advantage yes you have more control you have more control yeah yeah yeah yeah but the ship that we will travel with does it have a motor yes i am not sure actually but i guess it does because i am not even sure they would be allowed to sail without an engine nowadays huh so usually even the old tall ships have been equipped with engines but many of them were used for commercial activities such as fishing or transport then than they have been equipped a long time ago with them then thank you  or even built with them so yeah i am pretty sure it is also the fact that without an engine it would need a tugboat or some assistance every time it moors or it has to stop in a port great so that is an additional cost and so i guess it makes sense for them to have an engine of course i think it is safer you know yeah definitely because now there is the wind there is the wave yes as you know in the old days a ship might have to just wait 4 weeks if it did not have the right wind the right weather yeah yeah that would be dangerous for the crew as well and they had to stay on they could not i do not know like take out the boat and yes they could do that they could try to pull the ship with row boats ah okay but this is not something you can do for a long time thank you i mean it is very slow and very tiring for the crew to do this  though you might do it if it is an emergency or some special situation but i do not think you can do it for days on end to compensate for the lack of wind  and what actually take care happens if you have the bad wind and currents is that you might go very far from your course or even go back ooh 0 yeah in that case it does not help so much to use rowboats to pull the ship it sounds so difficult i everything is so difficult sailing used to be very much a season department i mean you would use a so depending on the season you are in you you would not be able to leave across the atlantic maybe unless it was spring and come back in the autumn  that is the trade wins actually ah yeah yeah yeah yeah i have heard of that when they traded i do not know they brought stuff from the colonies in america those 13 colonies thanks and they i do not know took indian furs here and you have to wait for the right season to do those thank you traveling yeah i have heard of that okay see you on vacation yes of course i cannot wait thanks bye bye (EDACC-C30-00)
hello my participant number is fc 25 p 2 please call stella ask her to bring these things with her from the store 6 spoons of fresh snow peas 5 thick slabs of blue cheese and maybe a snack for her brother bob we also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids she can scoop these things into 3 red bags and we will go meet her wednesday at the train station hello my participant number is id fc 25 p one please call stella ask her to bring these things with her from the store 6 spoons of fresh snow peas 5 thick slabs of blue cheese and maybe a snack for her brother bob we also need a plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids she can scoop these things into 3 bags 3 red bags and we will go and meet her wednesday at the train station okay good so we are done with the 1st part right okay should i start asking some questions or yeah hit me okay i wanted to talk about friendship 1st the 1st question i have is do you prefer to have many friends or just a few that you are close to for me i think a few that i am close with honestly i think having acquaintances and being familiar with people is one separate thing but what i deem friendship is someone close and i can be kind of be vulnerable with and open up to so definitely on the i would say a close amount i am how about yourself and why 0 i think just by my nature being more like like a secluded kind of person you i am not too extroverted let us go it is not like i am shy yeah but i just prefer having a few close friends you i like having acquaintances and being friendly even if i do not know people like i like to say hi there start a conversation but not get too close with most people but just a few so yeah i think again i think understanding that you do not need to open up to everyone and the few people that you do open up to and you decide to open to is still a big thing so regardless you have like a small amount or a big amount of friends it is important to have friends where we can open up i think that is the big thing we need to really focus on when we think about relationships and friendship it is like asking yourself yeah completely you know because yeah but i do not think there is just one way to have a close friend closeness is different for different people because with my close friends or who i think are my close friends yeah i do not really even need to talk to them too much it is more kind of like one of those things where we meet a few times a year have a good conversation you and then we live in different countries and everything we do not really but yeah yeah but that is what i am trying to say it is like i guess the different there is different like layers to like what of like how close you can be to a friend for me when i say close friend i am i mean someone genuinely like i can open up with i have talked to maybe not most all the time but i can you know like yeah level reliance but this is someone which i can be vulnerable with you know and okay i think yeah i think that is i mean but not everybody is like that though yeah because not everybody can be even vulnerable to themselves you know some people are very repressive so it is like i guess it is different for each for me it is this case for me yeah i think everyone has their idea of what being close to someone is i i do not know if you remember but i told you about that story of those 2 friends of mine that kind of stopped speaking because one of them felt like the other one was not you putting enough work into it while the other one yeah was just thinking that they were just doing enough because they are i ideas of what closeness should be like you like was different so yeah yeah it is completely different yeah i have a question as well go for it when you were a kid what kind of games did you play that is a long story i was a kid a long time yeah let me summarize just summarize in like just a few because of my brothers i played mostly like what is considered boys games so i played counter strike gta shooting games need for speed i think i played barbie games on my own but because they they are they were like competitive into shooting i did a lot of you counter strike so yeah did you have those storylines did you have those storylines with your bodies i am sorry i am sorry no i remember playing a barbie dress up game where they would go on a runway after and i and actually remember having so much fun with it and i tried to look it up recently and i just could not yeah find the exact game because there is so many alright rb games yeah i wish i could i feel like that would bring so many memories for me yeah yeah but yeah i think a lot of counter strike for sure what did you enjoy about those games i think gta i did not really know how to play it i just went around yeah but that is the whole fun of it you just do not really know you are just roaming around like free yeah but there is missions in gta so yeah it is a really nice story too as well i do not know the story i will see you next time i would just play like stealing cars and everything i think i enjoyed counter strike the most because of the social aspect of it because you could chat with people and also yeah people a lot of people from my town would play so it was a way to of meeting someone yeah what about you what games did you play i think you have a bigger history of gaming yeah like with games yeah 100% but if i had to really boil it down let us say around the era where i played on my 1st console which was a ps 2 i think there is i have 1000s of games but the ones that i probably deem probably most memorable and like probably definitely the top ones i enjoyed so much is definitely gta gta san andreas was so fun you although i was a kid and you know it is not a game for a kid it was just like having the freedom to roam around and do these kind of cool story missions and like actually involve it was not the most i do not know it was immersive for its time i guess but it was not crazy immersive but it was a nice storyline it was a very mature storyline but i still found it very cool and i just had the whole fantasy of like being this reckless you know crazy protagonist protagonist myself antagonist antagonist yeah definitely you antagonist that is true but another fond memory i have of a game is this one computer game i played on the laptop and it was like called pop tropical or something like that and you are like a little like like basic cartoon characters and you jump about and it is like cool little story it is like everything is in the 2 d it is all in 2 d so everything is flat 2 d so it was really cool it was fun it was just a lot of childhood memories on it i used to play with it play on it with my did you ever play papa is pateria no no no bye i every couple of years of my childhood and even probably adult years i would start playing it for fun and then i would get addicted because you want to expand more and more and more that was one one one of the online games i think i played a lot of like mini games like not the ones that you have yeah to download and stuff but just find and i will see you online yeah yeah for sure i think the most major game definitely has to be roblox now that i think about it yeah yeah yeah i was going to say i thought you were because when i when i entered that 1st we would almost 10 years ago now it was like 2011 bye i played so it is already been 10 years ago when i played for the 1st time it was amazing it was like the social hub for all the kids it was creative they had like a currency system we had material things before we went before we saturate you know in the market nowadays with like games that get by v bucks and things like that like packs and skins and things like that it was like the come up of like getting into that material materialization of like a fun game what games do you play now games i play now is simply i play valorant which is a 1st person shooter which is a tactical game is valorant a roleplay game valorant is not the roleplay you are known what is a role play game then i can give you my perspective on it but if you want a clearer one i am sure google always has the answer but for me what i deem as an rpg game a role play game which is rpg is something that has a kind of lore or aspect of it where you can how do i describe it it definitely has a deeper context and lore and you are brought into something which is like a storyline or you are brought into okay the main aspect of roleplay games is that usually there is like info on like attack points things like that damage points it is just more detailed of like what you do and there is more aspects of like storyline and developing a story yeah yeah yeah attack points and things like that you know and it is interesting because most of the roleplay games they invite you to be immersed in this whole new environment and they want you to be kind of like immersed in this character you create for example like roleplay games that i know of like skyrim that allow you to create your character and is not brought into just like a you know a pre built character but there is a okay there is roleplay games like witcher which is like a public roleplay game as well but it is important to character build but but as you know there is attack points there is storylines there is dialog you are immersed there is definitely more immersion in a role play game i would say okay got it yeah did you ever play rope again i am not sure no is that a roleplay no i have not played that yes we will i can not remember if i have ever played a role play game i do not think so right now i am just playing stardew valley which is a farming game we which i love a lot it is kind of addictive as well yeah i think i think stardew valley might be a role play i do not think so really you yeah yeah slardy valley is a simulation role playing game developed by yeah that is so confusing to me because from what you just explained i assume you that role playing means you get to meet other characters you get to like say things like choose what you want to say but i guess you can do that yeah i will ask okay i thought it was just a farming game i do not know bye because you are brought into a role of this character you create the creations there most role playing games have creations 0 okay okay okay okay so you play that wrong by creating your character you are in a role playing game time but for valerie because because the characters are pre made it is not real made and there is i am there is no like storyline to follow there is no like quests and things like that roleplay games typically have quests okay have this like like a linear narrative i think i would say valorant does not really have valorant does not have like a linear storyline it has like a linear gameplay of like you have to beat the enemy team and it is like you know it is like counter strike counter strike is not a role playing game okay i got it for sure yeah thank you yeah you want to ask me anything okay i will ask you something 0 what do people do during movies that really annoys you at the cinema  for at the movie theater okay i am going to be honest i am going to be honest everything that people have done that is annoying during movies is something which i have done myself so i can never really get to bye could get too annoying do not tell me you were one of those people who take the picture of the movie with flash on no no no no no no no okay exactly it was always a flash show 0 no that is just like insane because you are just you just like 0 social awareness because you do not really know what is going on that is the one i find the most annoying is when someone yeah i just do not understand the process flashback flash does not even help because you can now bye take a good photo for me it is just like speaking to yourself while watching the movie or like in the movie you know yeah yeah a lot of people do that when they watch the movie they go like 0 my god this is like this is like 0 no no you can not be doing this you know things like that out loud for the other person who is with them not just talking with themselves right not necessarily some people just do it themselves okay okay okay regardless it is like speaking during a movie it is a bit annoying because it is like i know what is happening on the screen i do not really need you to commentate you know and yeah i think that that and that is pretty much it really i think that is done everything else i do not really mind i do not mind laughing because i like laughing during movies even if it is like a serious movie for me i just really find it annoying if someone is speaking or taking photos with flash on or the one thing that you can not really do anything about it but when someone is crunching a lot with their chips bag or whatever yeah it is yeah i do not know i am that is why i am very self conscious when i mean it is just self conscious because employers that i am really worrying about it but no i am a sam conscious when i when i bring out like a chips bag or like a munchin on popcorn or like i am bringing out like my food i do it very slowly because i do not want to annoy i do not know what to say because all you can do is watch yeah that is what you are going to do you know it is like to crunch ones it is whatever right to open the back but to just constantly be crunching on it i do not know i know many people like my friend you know e dog he eats food slowly like me we crunch on it slowly because it does not make too much noise i would say that i enjoy watching movies by myself at home more than i do at the movie theater just because of other people yeah i do not really enjoy sharing the screen with everyone i think yeah see i think movies are supposed to be on the big screen yeah that is a good big screen but for me i want to be by myself and enjoy it fully and not worry but what are you worrying about people like making noises i just do not like i do not know i guess i like to talk to myself when i am home watching a movie okay so in the movie theater i can not do that yeah so what do you usually say i do not know i just comment on it yeah i know i have never done that in a movie theater i just do it when i am by myself i i go like 0 no way she did that or i cheer for a character or i get it i did that i did that recently i just feel free to do it yeah yeah yeah you are right you are completely right i did that yesterday on stranger things 0 and i have never usually done that i have never usually do that unless it is like a really good scene and i was just screaming like go run run run i was just clapping i was just clapping really loud and i think you are completely right but i have done that in the cinema as well like me and my friends we have done that we have got like really hype of a scene and we just yeah everyone was it because everyone did or was it just because you were not being everyone everyone everyone so for example like you know spiderman you know when the people come when they appear there is 3 geezers bye we just you know we make some noise and you know yeah they are high it was really fun alert spoil that feeling yeah but i think with certain movies the sound design the atmosphere is made for the cinema examples lighthouse i think batman also was made for the cinema the sound effects and music just everything sound design needs to be experienced i think in the big screen at least once i guess i guess just for sound but then again if you got a really good pair of headphones then it is thick time go for it i think i am put off from watching movies in the movie theaters because firstly tickets here are super pricey yeah also in my hometown there is like no movies yeah yeah yeah i can not yeah yeah yeah so i would have to travel 2 hours to get to a movie theater i mean that is more than fair enough i would rather like if i you invest in maybe i do not know i guess i do not need i do not even need to 0 a projector that is a cool experience i think that is cool you but i do not know of the i guess get a good projector rather than a cheap one because i guess the and we will see you next time quality would be grainy but i think just get a good pair of headphones and see how the experience changes or watch on the tv at least you know yeah that is fair good pair of headphones i am telling the sound like the movies are sensory right so it is what you you know you are you digest with the we digest with eyes and then what you hear you know because you can not taste a touch movie yeah i mean the quiet place have you seen the 1st part you have right yeah yeah i have seen that you can can not experience well on a computer or a laptop  because it is all about the sound and the surround bye that is something that i had to go to the movies for because because i was just like there is no way that this could work on own and i am and i am glad i did because it was all about the sound and the music so yeah that one is different did you watch the cinema yeah you i watched the 2nd part at home but yeah because i knew the 2nd part was not going to be as good so i did not want to bother you but the 1st one is this face the yeah john krasinski it is funny how i did not you know because i did not watch office before but i had seen that is the 1st time i would pretty much seen john krasinski krasinski or krasinski i do not know which one how you pronounce it but one of them i am sorry and then yeah it is just weird to think 0 wait that is the guy from you know arthurs yeah for me it was so weird to see him in a serious role because i only knew him as jim from the office and i was like bye there is i do not know but he is good he is good he is good he is good is not that sweet that is the same as yours yeah i have got another question go for it did you have a favorite book or film or tv show do i or did i did you as a child okay okay guys ciao what was it all about ooh that is a great question i think my favorite book was the diary of anne frank do you know much about it i know the premise of it and i know the yeah i know the premise okay i think i must have read that book as a kid at least like 4 or 5 times you firstly because i just loved kind of like diary type of novels or books or whatever i could get my hands off on that seemed like a diary i would love to read it because i was like i just want to know people is intimate thoughts that they are willing to share that i can read yeah but the 2nd thing is obviously how tragic her destiny was that was also compelling i do not know i just kind of connected with that book it must be because i was the same age as she was when she was writing it like 12 13 right so i think that was my favorite book and definitely influenced a lot of i think my look at how i look at life my favorite movie is is a kid must have been truman is show and i think that movie made me paranoid as a lot of people did become paranoid because it ever since i watched it i every now and again you think it is it is almost yeah it is yeah i think the whole premise of it was to kind of indict that thought but not necessarily to think you are someone watching you but to make you think is what we see before us really reality and have we just accepted it yeah i know it is and i think they did a very literal number on my yeah i think that did for me as well except for you asked for a movie tv show tv show as a child probably there is a lot of them i watched yeah there was a channel called fox life where they played a lot of sitcoms and i would watch them so much my brothers would call me a couch potato and they said even when i turn 30 i am going to be still watching fox life from my couch yeah because i just did it so much that is probably how i learned english as well that is good yeah but i would say the 1st one that i thought of was medium do you know what medium is no what is it about what is it all about stars this it stars a great actress i do not know if you know her her name is patricia arquette and she is basically someone who can kind of speak to ghosts but in a very like believable way in her dreams and telepathic kind of thing it is more it is more psychological than sci fi but it is bye i like it but but it is so so good so good she is such a good actress i i love that show bye those are my favorites what were yours nice my favorite book honestly i did not read much books as a kid in fact to be honest and brutally honest i have a hard time reading story books i love of contemplative yeah fiction i love nonfiction i love philosophical books i like spiritual books contemplative books anything that makes me think and digest it and you know actually like resonate or meditate on it i like that stuff stories not so much so if i had to say probably one as a kid diary of the wimpy kid i have never read that i think i wanted to though yeah it is like a childhood thing like every child from like kind of the era that kind of yeah that decade that era kind of read it it was like the hype i think i have fond memories of reading it because i guess the kids in it were quite similar to the age i was so it was just really interesting and yeah nothing crazy it was just fun it was just like you know really kiddie like little adventure things like you know i think it was one where they had to go on a holiday together and it was just interesting and the drawings were just you know they are cheap and not cheap i would say  my favorite film as a kid 0 i watched a lot of adult movies as a kid adult yeah like for grown ups i would say like mature movies like i watched yeah okay i watch scarface you know 0 god watched that when i was like 11 or 10 or 12 and i would imitate and i would i know i would say probably around 11 11 10 and i would imitate scarface and i would you know i would want to you know role model and glamorize it at school and things like that but i and i watched i think i watched godfather right then as well but i was i was watching like things like friday at 13 for such a young age and i was into like slasher movies like 0 i was into like i was really obsessed with jason voorhees for some reason you jason voorhees friday 13th you know the guy with the hockey mask listen for 0 yes yes yes from friday the 13th that is serious that is a serious i was just really obsessed with it god i do not i think i guess it was it was a bit like i was watching things like alien vs predator and i really was obsessed with predator and things like that just all these like you know mature movies so if i have to say a favorite film which i watched over and over again i think i have a strong attachment or liking of simple and beautiful spider man 2 sam raimi is 2004 spider man 2 it had all the tropes i am like like love things like a really cool villain a broken villain who was a had a decent kind of story at the beginning and introduction of like you know this guy is really cool and then becomes an octopus killer guy it was awesome from the soundtrack from who is the soundtrack for sam raimi is it was a he still does music now you you know who did the spiderman thing no i do not let me look it up really big guy really big really big famous the name will ring of course jay robert harris paul francis webster no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no right room the guy danny elfman there you go okay i have never heard of that danny elfman you have never heard of danny elfman no he did the score for the original batman he did the score for beetlejuice tim burton is he did the score for doctor strange in the multiverse of madness he did the soundtrack for charlie and the chocolate factory he did edward scissorhands he did alice in the wonderland apparently 50 shades of gray madame blanche 0 my goodness  you want to know something funny but i was going to take a look at 50 shades of gray and i could not get past the 1st 2 minutes it was so cringy yeah the acting is so weird the script the dialog it is just it seems like a child group yeah thanks kenneth i can imagine yeah i mean i was going to pick spider man 2 and my favorite tv show let us go with tv show tv show just i did not watch tv shows i am going to go with the cartoon i think okay okay okay i want to go i am just playing 0 it is a tough one it is out of spongebob and there is a tough one but you did not did not watch a single tv show like lost or anything like that as a kid no not really like no i was born to like family guy in south park i think south park damn it is tough it is tough because it is interesting because most of my humor is based on that you know like south park and spongebob pretty much that is all it is like that is some accumulation such a weird mix because one of them is such innocent humor and the other one is dirty and vulgar yeah i think that i mean that describes me well does not it i do not know i think you just i just like memes that no one understands except me i did before now i just love anything like organic memes being like things like situations in real life and a lot like spongebob situations a bit honestly and south park situations but if i had to pick 10 it is tough i am going to go with south park because i have the most fond memories of binging all the south park episodes i played a world of warcraft because of south park because of that one episode so i am going to go with south park it was just funny it was just next thanks for watching questions it is my turn are you very motivated to do things or do you kind of need to wait for motivation to strike you see i think i am going to question your question i can it is okay no what i am going to say i think you need to be more specific it is like well am i motivated to do things or what yeah just everyday things whether they are big projects or just like a shower or anything do you feel like you are mostly unmotivated or like generally motivated person i think jen john is the gun i think generally motivated but there are definitely phases where i can not be asked to do anything and i become very lazy there is a mix really it is a spectrum and it is a mix for me but for the most part like if i need to brush my teeth or i need to do something sometimes i do not do them and i can not be asked but for the most part if i say i need to do something i usually do it yeah what about what chores that people give you like things that people want you to do for them yeah like for school do you feel motivated right away but that is different it depends if like who people who these people you know it is like it is different for everyone family and friends and school is completely different because it depends on if you are invested in school or not for me for me i yeah i can do everything family want me to do so cool sometimes i am forgetful and usually i am forgetful but it does not mean that i will not do it if you remind me i will do it i am motivated to do school i am motivated to do the things that which i enjoy and things i am not really got much interest or passion about then i have a hard time getting motivated about but you can see how it is all different across the board it is not like one general like motivated okay fair enough have by yourself i think my motivation depends a lot on my physical well being because when you are a bit anemic like i am your life energy gets sucked out of you i know and you are not like the psychological motivation is not even in question because i just need to lay in bed but i do not think i would describe myself as lazy sometimes i just need to say ok i can not do these things today and that is it i guess i do procrastinate on work quite a bit yeah obviously because yeah definitely feel procrastination procrastination but always do it on time somehow yeah i guess you are motivated when you are at the last straw yeah i guess my motivation is like this same as me it depends on free will like if i feel like i need to do something where i have to do it i put it off but if something is by my free will yeah and i do it faster and i am more yeah because it comes from bye sir it does not come from a place of forcing comes from financial impulse and that is like the most that is the best thing in the world when we can be our natural selves and follow impulses which are i mean we are conscious of and kind of like be okay with them or we know we observe them be like okay this is it like a beneficial impulse like i am going to get things done but it is just going with the flow and it is when the flow goes your way should we say to make it right yeah yeah it is awesome i love him to do okay my question 0 i it is such a loaded question that is a simple one i guess actually not that simple no it is not no it is not no it is not for me personally what do you think what do you think i do not think what do you hear i do not think that there is that is right huh i said obviously you do not know for sure because no one knows what happens after death but no no no no everyone has an opinion on it though i personally do not think that there is anything such as like reincarnation or heaven or hell like all those things are such material concepts that we are just like that is what we can think of with our limited human capacity to think i think whatever comes after you die with your consciousness is something that sorry it cannot be put in terms of words or even something that we can imagine it is it is just something way beyond right right i think what happens with the body is clear i would have happens with the consciousness that is something that we can not comprehend and therefore i can only dream or imagine about it but i can not really i can not really yeah by the idea that i come back as something or that i really on to like this heaven or hell i do not know yeah yeah i think some sort of energy that is left behind me even if it is like a physical sense of energy or yeah whatever that can transform into other things material even or even other things another other people so in that sense it could be similar to reincarnation but yeah yeah yeah that is interesting yeah okay bye bye i think you definitely i think i have a i think 100% agree with it is something you can not fathom glimpses of and touch but i think we need to understand that there has been people that have been far ahead and they have been under they felt and i have experienced the unfathomable unfathomable and they have kind of like you know they gave into the dialects but again that is just things like we have been told and it is like some things that things like heaven all this heaven and hell and things like yeah as projections of like you know different states or whatever this and this and this i just need for me personally based on my experience and feeling it feels like i would like to believe there is i do not know is not even a form of liking it is like well whatever happens happens but i definitely think there is reincarnation for no reason there could be possibly reincarnation but there is definitely different higher planes of existence and reality and things bye more deeper understanding of life and that i think that ranges from people i think when i was reading this book recently it is talking about how if you you know people have like past regression like you know people can learn about their past lives you know and when they when they learn about their past lives and things like that they usually do not like it because it reminds them that you know they have been through a lot of things over and over again which i think you know makes me feel as if like we have been okay that is fair well we need to start another meeting so because this one is out of time so was it for the end no it has not yet it will in a minute but on i will just send you an invite again okay you because 40 minute limit unless you upgrade so i will just send you thank you okay be

read the small package let me check it a small passage yeah okay yes so i will start saying this package 1st okay i will go ahead now please call okay ask her to bring these things with her from the store 6 spoons of fresh snow peas 5 thick slabs of blue cheese and maybe a snack of her brother boop we also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids she can scoop these things into

for her brother bob we also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids she can scoop these things into 3 red bags and we will go meet her wednesday at the train station that is great my friend so i think the next thing is to answer these questions listed here so we are all choosing the 1st question 1st yeah sure would you like to start one i will talk about when you were a kid what kinds of games did you use to play is there one you remember well yeah yeah and i love this sort of cause like the normal life sounds be a bit boring at the time but so yeah one game i remember do you remember i think because you played with me you used to play with me league of legends you know this game yes of course i do i mean we spend most of our free time playing this game yeah even our busy time we used to escape things to play the game and yeah years ago this game was a lot different than now but however like so let us start tell me please what did you like the most about the game and why did you choose it in particular to be in this game so basically it is just because i like competitive games and i mean league of legends is one of the most famous games in this category and also i like communicating with other people so and it does have a chat of course yeah it is not the most friendly one of course the kubernetes he does the job yeah yeah and you know there is a variety of champions it has like around 150 champions so you know you do not get bored that easily because there is always a new champion to try exactly you they are like 160 something like that yeah there are a lot you and yeah you get to try new strategies and you know like 160 champions even if you play one champion there are still many combinations depending on your team picks and so on so i mean yeah you get to try a lot of different things and what about you yeah well okay let us honestly there is a lot to talk about 1st of all the thing that is all these characters or the champions they have their own background story they have like and i love these stories that i love this word like the fantasy and the words that are far different from reality so when you read about a champion and their backstory i get attached to it and i feel like i am this champion by my own yes for example there are 2 champions that i used to love the most of course you remember the zed one the champion and he is like a ninja that controls shadows and stuff so i have been thinking and imagining being a ninja who can throw shurikens at enemies even in real life i used to mix between the real life and the real life yeah twisted fate like we can in a 2nd alter the reality and enter into the body of the other champion that is twisted fate and i started talking like him moving or behaving like him the attitude and everything and twisted fate used to play with cars so i bought cars here from the store and i used to like paint these cars with colors to make it it definitely sounds cool to have some super power yeah exactly so i used to imagine like being into these characters and as you mentioned there are like many more than 150 souls that made the whole story a lot more fun and a lot more like you know interesting because you you do not you do not have to stick to one personality or one champion you have many so you can always get that exciting and adrenaline after playing a new champion and trying to get the most out of it the other thing yeah well yeah i think i like the social level a little bit the chat and the social aspect however it was not that the big thing for me the best experience yeah the community is so toxic you know everybody knows that however i like like the as you mentioned also the what is it the strategy play yeah yeah that is strategic play and this stuff it feels like a mind game it is a mind game actually and yeah it means a lot yeah of like using iq and the mind skills because it is a lot similar to a chess but with different colors and instead of like a specific piece of a chess that is made in a specific way we know like i do not know if they call it the horse for example the horse for example it moves in a shape of l yeah you need to plan these so same thing every champion has got his own or her own abilities so you know their movements and you try to predict the other teams or the enemies movement and your movement as well and start to plan accordingly so yeah it is a yeah very strategic playing and it uses like the brain and stuff so it boosts the cognitive or the intelligence ability just as the chess yes and i would actually argue that it could be harder even harder than chess yeah of course so many factors yeah that was like yeah i mean like there is the jungle monsters the minions and even the enemy champions you have to strategize every move because one mistake and you could fall to an enemy champion yeah especially because he used to play jungle role so yeah you had a lot of pressure from our team enemy team because obviously they will be flaming you if you mistake and our team as well and everyone especially me of course remember because honestly man it was a jungle difference if you helped me a lot in the mid lane i could have won many of my games 0 come on man no you were the one who was ending yeah yeah but it was definitely fun and it definitely requires lots of thinking strategizing and so on yeah getting the game objectives and planning how to get each one of those especially when the bot lane is not helping to get the dragon yeah different universe but they are still playing the game yeah and like and you have got like a very big responsibility because at the end of that day even if we did not help you at anything we will start framing you blaming you for losing the objectives the friends of dragons and the rest herald and the baron yeah these are yeah yes and actually one of the lanes that you would feel like they are playing chess indeed is the top lane they are always there yeah they live in their own universe you know exactly especially in nasus versus like kayle or something 2 people just want to stack and get scale at the game nasus players like especially the nasus mains they are like wow yeah there are different categories of people there are not like other people like there are different categories i imagine them like a chat quiet person who is playing the chess yeah i mean it almost feels like a pve game for them you yeah just farming minions and so on you never see them during the game until like 30 minutes through so yeah they are definitely playing their own game yeah but you know what it is worth it if they are like a good player the good players of them they are worth it because they do a huge impact over the entire game when they did their role properly yeah of course however i mean if you are absent you are wearing the entire game until 30 minutes and your team is so behind then there would be no coming back from that exactly that is the saddest and the worst part to be honest i used to play top lane sometimes and i used to pick nasus to scale and stuff but my whole team totally entered the game to the extent that there is no coming back i do not have enough armor or magic resistance to fight all of those it is already too late even if i skilled to the maximum the the time to buy items and like stack items and stacks for the abilities so it is usually too late and i feel like so sad because it is not fair for me i have not even played the game i was waiting for the next phase of the game and i just i was just starting and 0 my god the game is gone what am i supposed to do now it is not even fair yes actually i mean i think that the rewarding style i mean when you take out an enemy champion it rewards you thank you instead of just doing nothing that is a cool aspect about the game because then i mean you feel like you actually did something to win the game and you know create an advantage for your team yes exactly that is gratification in a sense so yeah i guess that is it for this question okay perfect so let us move on to the 2nd question yes let us go okay so did you have a favorite book or film or tv show or cartoon as a child yeah but actually we are going into the other section of the recording so let us end this one and start another one okay yeah bye bye (EDACC-C40_P1)
so hi again hi hi okay that is nice so let us start i will start 1st let me see so my id is fc 28 p one and my id is fc 28 p 2 that is nice so let us start with the passage okay perfect you go ahead okay please call stella ask her to bring these things with her from the store 6 spoons of fresh snow peas 5 thick slabs of blue cheese and maybe a snack for her brother bob we also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids she can scoop these things into 3 red bags and we will go meet her wednesday at the train station that is nice perfect okay please call stella ask her to bring these things with her from the store 6 spoons of fresh snow peas 56 slabs of blue cheese and maybe a snack of her brother bob for her brother bob we also need a small plastic snake and the big toy frog for the kids she can scoop these things into 3 red bags and we will go meet her wednesday yes kind of yeah yeah okay so let us go to the next question where which is yeah did you have a favorite book or film or tv show or cartoon as a child yeah that is of course i had a favorite like i had favorite books not one and yeah because i used to read a lot of novels so basically i used to like most of them because i was really picky as a child so yeah i only picked the good ones so yeah one of them was let me remember one of them was the fear valley or the valley of fear something like that and it used to be brilliant and i used to think about it a lot even after i finished it for many many years because i really really liked the character in this novel it was a police character but we did not know during the whole novel bye yeah that was like something that we got this we discovered at the end of the at the end of the novel that was really shocking and it was  yeah it was surprisingly shocking and yeah this man he was like very tough man very intelligent quick mind and very strong and yeah he has got like he was like wow the super male character you would like to to be yeah i like that giga chat character yeah i really like this personality and i even used to try to behave like him like just like league of legends whenever i like someone i feel like i want to like get try to be some yeah be like them in some way exactly so yeah like i will tell you about the situation imagine at the criminals club or the criminals clan he wanted to go into so he can get them caught they had something like an entrance exam you in which they had to do something that is very hard like you know this metal thing that they used to print some shapes on the back of the horses yes yeah yeah they put it on fire until the metal is like is red yeah the heat and then they print it on the body and the skin of the horse and it is very tough thing imagine they used to do that in that clan on horses or humans i want the humans i wanted to join them wow that is something i definitely do not want to try yeah exactly like no one has ever run into something like that yeah they used to do it on their shoulders and keep their shoulders exposed so anyone who goes around they know that this is one of these criminals or one of these clans so they fear them they do not want to like you do not want to get involved with those people like they are so criminal they are so tough because you actually can see this through once you see the the thing printed on their shoulder yeah yeah they have gone through that yes it is like a right of passage and also a print to identify the client right exactly not only that imagine that the factor on which you succeed or do not succeed in this exam that while they are doing that while they are melting your own skin printing the shape you should not say any like ouch or anything like that it should be as quiet as possible it is even if you want to scream so loud you are not allowed to if you scream they will kick you away or they will kill you because they are criminal and murder and that seems like a test that i would definitely fail yeah of course like 0 my god i can not even imagine and yeah now now here comes the protagonist my favorite character he enters this test and i wanted to know how would he act this brilliant mind so he was negotiating not to take the test but okay he said like okay it is just a stupid test i think that you are muted 0 i was muted so well what was the last thing you heard when he was going to enter the test that it was just some easier stupid test yeah and then they they thought he was afraid from doing the test then he said okay then i will do it and they started heating up the metal thank you and then they put it onto their skin on the shoulder and his skin and then he did absolutely no reaction he did not even blink tough guy yeah he stood still like not not not even a blink that was amazing like everybody was shocked like 0 my god it was astonishing and that is why i was like i am so thrilled and i was into this character like look at how tough he is like any man of us aspires to be a tough person and tough man because that is what what is expected from men at the end of the day yeah so yeah that was the toughness and the thing that was very very like very inspiring yeah that was yeah i really love that so yeah the that is one book should i go move into okay you move about you talk about your book then we move into the other section of the question yeah sure so my favorite book was an arabic book it is called diamond dust and that is that is a nice name yes cool it is a book that talks about well 1st of all it is just a doctor and his father living alone and his father is paralyzed so he has to of the son has to take care of his father all of the time  however one day he returns to find that his father was murdered and then you know he goes through and investigates finds out that his father had a past history and he used what they would call diamond dust to like assassinate people who had you know well that test or so you and then he decides to investigate who killed his father why he did it he meets this officer who starts directing him at a like a famous character a rich character in the country telling him that this is the one that murdered him due to some reasons he keeps like investigating it you know it keeps you yeah i can tell i am trying to imagine since you said dust of diamonds i am trying to imagine what does such dust look like yeah i do not think that thing actually exists or it does not do what they say it did to people maybe but the idea itself is so catchy yes exactly and actually what i like the most about the book is that at the end it is like a shock that he finds out that the one who murdered his father is actually the officer that he met 0 yeah because his father saw the officer dealing in drugs and so on and yeah so the son took on and continued his father is path and assassinated the officer as well wow that is so cool actually and what a surprise as well yeah i love the idea like the notion of following the father is path or the heritage and the legacy i like those kind of notions because at the end of the day we are part of the past we are part of a legacy we are part of something we did not just exist into the world we have not been thrown from nowhere here to the universe later legacy or your past you use it a lot and doing a lot of things like it gives you a source of power a source of knowledge about yourself if you are like if it is as superficial as someone has nothing to know about who has no mind like his brainwashed or something like that he does not know anything about the past like you i do not know he does not have something to connect to or maybe if he or she found something to connect to it will be a bit weaker thank you connection than a connection that comes from the very past like you if you have a big an ancient family for example and you are a descendant of this ancient family you know like you have got power you have got like yeah yeah because life does not go to the back and forth life is going one way yes definitely others yeah exactly and actually i mean i liked a lot the idea that that i mean you perceive an image of someone but no matter how close that person is to you you would never know everything about them like he had this idea of his father that is like this very kind person who would never hurt someone and he is actually paralyzed too so you would not be able to you but then he finds out that his father was assassinating people by putting diamond dust in their drinks so you know and their drains in their dreams fascinating yeah so i mean it is something to think about of course yeah i love those kind of stories so yeah let us go to the other tv show yep so you go ahead 1st okay no worries i would love to go 1st about this one because my favorite show is one that is everybody is favorite show as well and i do not believe otherwise if someone said any other show is better than this one i would never believe that because we all know that breaking bad is the best of all time yeah i mean i see people talking a lot about it but honestly i have not watched breaking bad yet my i know you are missing a lot you are not missing like i do not even know if you are worthy to watch the show anymore you like you missed your biggest opportunity in this life i mean i have it on my to watch list i am going to watch it eventually however i mean i have not done that yet yeah the the question is does does the show have you on the list of words the people who can actually watch them i do not know man i really do not know but yeah the break people is talking about i am not going to what is that like really it is not going to spoil anything for you but i am going to yeah speak about the general idea general idea of the show which is like it appears in the trailer or something so it is not a big deal you to be aware of it starts with a chemistry tutor or a chemistry teacher high school teacher who develops cancer and a very good chemistry teacher who used to be he wanted to do a phd and be very like one of the doctors but the circumstances the odds were not in his favor so yeah yeah he just was so depressed about the cancer and what he is going to do about his life his life is ending soon and he has got a family and stuff but then he actually decides to do drugs but not do drugs he wanted to make drugs being thank you one of the best chemists in the whole world he did the best drugs ever it was a substance called methamphetamine or meth and he started doing this meth and actually i do not know if i can go any further i do not want to spoil that piece of art the masterpiece or anything i do not want to spoil it in any house so yeah i will just have that it actually sounds interesting yeah but i think you should watch the trailer as well but anyway the yeah neither of the trailer or any idea it will not have one of the actual tv show so you should actually watch the tv show to know what is in it to know what is this how cool it is yeah yeah because it is not a movie it is something like a bit longer so you need to like live with the characters and see what is going to happen yes definitely 0 a cartoon as well yeah you can go ahead now you go ahead 1st okay so for the tv show i guess my favorite would be friends i will i mean i have had so many memories with this show i like it very much because it gives you these vibes you know it boosts your mood it is comedy is not it yes it is it talks about i mean it is about a group of friends and you know the drama sometimes the drama between them and most of the time the comedy you have this character which is called chandler he is like the sarcastic guy in the group you and there is joey who is not very smart but he you he is good with the girls yeah the guy yeah and then there is ross who is like the nerd of the group who has a phd in paleontology and that is it he studies like the fossils of dinosaurs and so on i see yeah and these are the 3 guys there is also 3 girls the 1st one is monica who is like obsessed with cleaning i needs everything to be sparkling i am out and yeah and there is phoebe who is like you know at 1st you think like how can a person be i do not know like this spontaneous but she is actually my favorite character of them all she is very spontaneous fun you would feel like she is one of your friends somehow really actually all of them would be i mean after 10 seasons you would create a connection with them of course yeah yeah they caused the atmosphere the bond even with the show especially with fun people like that yeah it does absolutely feel like that yes exactly and the last one is rachel who is like this sassy girl who comes from a rich family yeah and yeah she is like crying most of the time if anything even small happens yeah and then it is mostly about how they deal with each other and other people and yeah it is very fun to watch you are going to enjoy it if you have not watched it yeah actually i had an idea or an impression that was telling me do not watch this because i saw the parts of it or like a quick clips and it was not that fun hey i do not think they are funny as they appear to be but maybe because i watched very little to be able to judge or know what is going on i think if i started the show from the beginning it could be a lot different yes to be honest the 1st season is not that great i mean you will have some parts where you are left but moving forward it will be funny yeah i am going to enjoy well the best thing that i actually love about the comedy things that usually the main characters they do not die yeah you get to live with them and have a happily peaceful life which is the thing that we deserve but actually like sometimes you just want to i do not know wow emotional people they just want to cry you and get them to feel miserable just like me for absolutely no reason like if you ask me why would you do this i just do not know but i it is like we somehow like or love the feelings of sadness and the feelings of these dark feelings we love it somehow or we enjoy it somehow i i i used to i think the stavisky the russian writer used to describe such an enjoyment of things that we are supposed to enjoy but yeah even though we are sad we enjoyed the experience which is weird like how someone is sad and they enjoyed the experience at the same time yeah it is kind of like contradictory yeah that is a good topic to think about is not it yeah i would love to apply for a degree in psychology that you seem to be very much into psychology students so i think that is it for this recording okay perfect okay see you on the next one okay bye bye bye (EDACC-C40_P2)
hi my participant number is fc 28 p one hi and my participant number is fc 28 b 2 okay so where were we we were talking about our favorite cartoons and films yes exactly yeah i would like to start about this one because yeah that is my favorite film and i never get bored of talking about that it is the prestige i do not know if you know it but it is about i do really yes i am good luck thank you very much yeah it is a very cool movie especially because it mentions many many of the things that i personally love it is about tesla the greatest or one of the greatest known physicists and of course major in physics that is why i love that idea and i love like thank you as a scientist personally and he had like a very bright mind and yeah that was very cool and also the idea that the invention that they were talking about in the movie they kind of duplicated duplicating or replicating humans or anything no that was really interesting like living creatures yeah and the magic part was amazing really and they acted very brilliantly that was one of the best movies i ever saw but one of the drawbacks of this movie is that it is a little bit long it is too long i think 3 hours of runtime something like that yeah however i mean i did not have any trouble with the length of the movie it was actually a pretty good one and my favorite part was the surprise when they revealed that they were actually twins and not just one person yeah and i also think that the movie teaches us that the hatred or the envy can lead us absolutely nowhere it leads to more hatred and more trouble and more evil yeah nothing out of it like remember when the one of the magicians so yeah i was saying i think i muted myself or something right i do not know if it was by mistake or somehow because the movie revealed that this man had like psychological issues and they were twins and stuff like maybe one of them like was not responsible for for killing her and the other one was like maybe had a psychological issue as he saw from the notes when when he stole the notes and then he seen is seeing that he had like some yes i mean i do not remember that part very clearly because i watched the movie like a long time ago yeah i see so yeah i was saying that this person one of the musicians dedicated their lives to get revenge and i mean to avenge his fiancee see and he just spent his life trying to kill the other person trying to cause him severe pain or inflict upon him all the kinds of pain and miseries and the other one kind of did the same somehow so they were just enemies to each other and they spent their life instead of enjoying their lives they lived for destroying you yeah he calls himself to be killed so he just lost his life lost his sanity lost his happiness and everything for nothing for something that is considered to be past even if it was very painful even if someone stabbed you in the back yeah regardless of how painful the issue is or the thing is it is something of the past and we need to learn to let things happen and let go in order for us to have the ability to live further because time marches on and only one direction it never goes the other way yes that is definitely true ok so what about your favorite movie okay so i actually have 2 favorite movies i will start 1st by the english movie which is interstellar this this is yeah man wow my favorite yeah thanks for mentioning that i really love this movie i was actually always fond of astrology and you know the idea that the universe is so vast and black holes and so on when you read about it it is very very interesting and then seeing that these ideas are like on the screen in a movie and yeah that was i mean the movie actually had some accurate information it discussed the idea of the black hole and that you know when you move very close to a black hole time slows down yeah you from a physics point of view i could definitely confirm and agree with that yes so the movie was i mean scientifically it was very good to some extent of course i mean they have to add some sci fi force to make it interesting but i mean i liked it very much and also it had the the emotional drama to you know attract you and make you get involved there so yeah that was definitely one of my favorites and yeah yeah i even heard the producer of the movie had to attend physics classes in order to produce the movie that way he had to go to physics courses can you imagine it was so dedicated yes exactly and i actually think that the model of the black hole that they animated was done by yeah on actual physics as well it was so cool like amazingly cool i mean the scene itself is so thrilling and eye catching and like capturing and i like i can not find words that describe how great the scene was yes i mean i remember i think i watched the video back then that they said they had to ask a scientist for help to make some calculations and determine how a black hole would look like in real life and they actually got it i mean i think they got it right because a few years ago when the 1st picture of a black hole was released it was kind of close yeah i love clothes yeah i actually thank you yeah go ahead no no no no no okay so i actually like the scene when he goes into the black hole that was very amazing and it captured my attention and i used to overthink about it like days and days when he saw like the frames of the past like he used to like he went into the black hole and he i am going to go get some more started seeing the past and he started seeing the past in some sort of like frames kind of way it was because he was like traveling through the past and he was seeing the moments of the past as frames and he could like go into that exact frame that he wanted or that exact moment and interact with that and what caught my attention yes definitely also some of the parts that i liked about the movie i mean there was this part when he was at his ship and then he received a message from his daughter which was now almost 30 i think yeah that was so dramatic and and emotional yes i mean i almost cried at that scene it was very good i already did yeah yeah and i mean matthew mcconaughey did such a great job he is a absolutely great actor yeah and then my 2nd favorite movie is actually a japanese animation movie 0 no and weirdly enough it is also a romance i am it is called kimi no nawa or in english your name  the movie talks about 2 teenagers who wake up one day and find out that they have exchanged bodies they did not know each other but the boy found himself in a girl is body and the girl found herself in his body and then they have to you know live each other is life  then they i mean they try to put rules to each other like leave a notes on the mobile asking who are you and then set rules by write down what you did in the day and do not do that do not do this and so on just to organize their lives when they are in the other person is body then they start falling in love with each other and then 0 my god then it gets better then at some point they stop exchanging bodies suddenly so the boy starts wondering what happened and starts looking for the girl he finds out that the girl actually died 3 years ago no way yeah after comet crashed on the i mean on the school area where she lives no way that is so sad yes however it does not end in a sad way because it starts looking for her still and go to the same place finds out that she really did die in a comet crash and finds out like that this big crater where she used to live and somehow he travels back in time i mean you will need to watch it it is definitely amazing the movie is very good i would definitely do unless and it has a good ending i am not going to spoil it for you i already spoiled like 80 to 90% of the movie i would definitely watch the movie but after these spoilers i am not quite sure because like things like i already know what is everything is going to happen what is anything that is going to happen so yeah but i think it is worth watching even after the spoilers it is definitely is i mean i highly recommend this movie it is my favorite one well i have 2 favorites as you can see yeah i see i can imagine if i swapped my body with a girl or like the 1st thing that i think about it could be very silly and funny at the same time like how would they think of their private parts it was actually funny yeah this is funny the very 1st thing i would do is to go to have a look at myself naked in a mirror or something but however i do not think it would be like i am not quite sure because if we could exchange souls but maybe our sexual preferences it changed because we are basically in a different body and the sexual preference is a matter of yes however they did not discuss this part thank god yeah exactly just the idea would be interesting that is it and like yeah it is kind of experiment okay so and that is cool let us see if we can move on to another question thank you have you mentioned your favorite cartoon have we talked about the cartoons 0 right yeah we actually did not talk about our favorite cartoons would you like to go 1st yeah i can go 1st well at the beginning like i used to like my whole childhood was like watching cartoons that was like 99% of my childhood so i lived with cartoons i have many favorite cartoons i love almost all of them so i like i will briefly mention one of the things that i like the most one of them was i remember yeah a little it was so cool i loved riots then and how brain was always planning to rule the world and control the world and dominate the human world and despite the fact that he was merely a lab rat he was so small he had so little things to work with yet he had this big yes it was actually very fun it was very funny yeah it teaches us like some some lessons about ambitions and like it does not matter how big the dream is you can like having a brain you can always plan for it and yeah the yeah we can never turn a blind eye on the pinky the funniest character ever the dumb mouse yeah and i actually do not remember if he ever was able to you know like achieve his dream it was like kind of the main source or the main cause of the failures of the brain plans however i like the fact that they fought but they were actually friends they had each other and they kind of loved each other so their true thank you so despite the fact that they argue a lot because brain had plans and pinky was just spontaneous going around they actually at the end of the day they could not lose each other yes exactly and i will talk about my favorite cartoon as well you thank you all right thank you all right thank you all right thank you all right thank you all right thank you all right

actually one of my favorites because it was very funny and the idea that you have like sheep that are so smart you know and the dog who tries to herd them that was yeah very cool idea and it was i think it was made in stop motion which is like they you know make these like play characters and then they take pictures and then move it and then take another picture and really combine bye yes i think 0 and then they combine it you are not sure yes i mean stop motion i think the general idea of stop motion aha i see but i mean it is very cool and the show was very funny yeah i totally agree with that and yeah i would also like to mention another cartoon that i could never like forget and i really wanted to mention which is ninja turtles i am because one thing i really loved ninja the other thing is that i love turtles as well so having both of them and like the same show that was so cool to me i loved ninja to the extent that i ordered a ninja suit in the past and i used to ask my brother  made from metal they used to fight with and ninja had many like weapons to fight with sticks and shurikens swords and many other things i used to like love weapons and the art itself of like using weapons and also yeah so it was very interesting to me to see like ninja is work and yeah yeah it was like very respectful character and yeah like feels so strong and so wise i used to take his wisdom for real yeah his quotes and the stuff i used to write them and live into the character and i somehow i wanted to be a ninja but like when i am older like a lot older and the age of my yeah i think that if you would like to start learning i mean you will need to travel to china or japan or something yeah japan it is originated in japan yeah i still think till this day that ninja is a pretty cool martial arts it is a martial arts and it is like a good one it is not a weak martial arts but it like it used to be some sort of an art not like the very common martial arts that people do i think the best the most famous things were even till now the karate yeah i actually used to i mean i did study or train in some kung fu before really compose the 2 the chinese by the way unlike karate stay safe cartoon japanese i actually never knew really haha wow it was like for just one month or so yeah i mean it did not last that long i see yeah what else like i am thinking what else have i missed to mention about the ninja turtles yeah of course their intro song it was so great actually it used to make me very motivated and very energetic and like charged and hardwired like yeah ninja turtles you listen to the arabic or the english opening both actually both i actually do not think i ever watched the ninja turtles cartoon bye i did watch some of the videos no no you are not saying that to me you have not watched ninja turtles how could you yeah i am sorry like i will not let that go like this i will like me after this recording i will let you watch like an episode or 2 i

this meeting is being recorded hi my participant is name is fc 39 p 2 please call stella ask her to bring these things with her from the store 6 spoons of fresh milk please 5 tech slaps of blue cheese and maybe a snack for her brother bob we also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids she can scoop these things into 3 red bags and we will go meet her wednesday at the train station so participant 2 can you tell me what kind of games he used to play when you were a kid when i was a kid i used to play with a lot of toys i liked so much to play with dolls but also i liked to play with cars my brother had a lot of cars i used to play with and he was always angry when i was taking we used to play mostly outdoor games too we were gathering all the kids from my neighborhood i used to play tennis i loved it and we were collecting flowers from all over the neighborhood we were going to the beach together and making sand sculptures and stuff and we were playing lots of sports mostly outdoor sports we also did that and i also used to sew some dresses for my dolls but my brother always was hiding me those things 0 that is really bad and how did you find it thank you it is all closed at the end yeah i was finding it somehow because they were always on the same place and how often when did you used to go to the beach with your friends i used to go 2 or 3 times per week we were living near the sea so we were often going to a beach we were going around 4 p m until the sunset so it was the best time to swim a little bit to play with the other kids to watch the sunset well i really love going to the beach and i still love it and we were always waiting for some adult to come with us because our parents will not let us to go alone because we were too young right and we were going almost every day depends if an adult is free every day we will go every day and we used yes it has a lot of like to cycling yes and i always wanted to bring some books with me so we were swimming almost all day and on the breaks we were reading books from school the teacher used to give us i do not really remember if i had any favorite book but i really enjoyed them and what about you did you bring any no i was bringing only both at the beach usually i was reading the books from school in the morning so i had to spend 2 or 3 hours per day reading all the books and another plus literature i really enjoyed reading also i know that yeah you know when the 2 sisters are getting to know each other after a couple of times they were separated after their birth and luckily that book had a very happy ending so i liked that book a lot that is great i can not remember i really loved reading stories with my sister especially before going to bed and we were reading the stories from the cartoons we used to watch yeah also me and my brother were watching cartoons all the time actually not all the time but for a couple of hours per day let us say 2 or 3 because my mother and my father did not let me let us watch for the whole day i like the cartoon especially tom and jerry the fast bird spongebob especially and also now i am watching maybe frozen i am sorry frozen yeah also frozen it is really nice cartoon yes it was really popular yeah the cast many many episodes like the simpsons or tom and jerry and i think frozen is only 2 or 3 episodes it is like a movie right yes yes as i remember and did you used to play any sports on the beach for example we love playing volleyball or just some regular sport games in the water because i really love sports i used to play basketball when i was younger and till today i really love sports in general and that is why i always yeah also we were used to play a lot of sports at the beach we were playing volleyball and we were playing different sports in the water but we like to swim a lot i am a very good swimmer so i like to compete with the others not only with my friends but also with my family so i am always well not actually i am not into winter sports much i am more in outdoor sports like running and swimming i do not like winter and we never used to go on a winter holiday i do not know why maybe we could not afford that but we are lucky we live on a place like this so we are available and we can go i like going to holidays i do not have some place which i prefer to go often but for the next trip i would like to go to bali so i think i want to go there because i like the nature so much it has beautiful beaches it is not that that is great it is a place with long sand beaches with a city for wild nature many animals you can see there so i think it will be a great place for 2 weeks vacation or 3 well i would really like to go to some warm place where there is a beach in front i really love summer and i would go wherever it takes i want to go for example maybe in mexico and because there are really interesting places and beaches to see there and if i choose to go i full of what a full history yes yes and if i would choose to go somewhere in europe i would go in italy or spain and there are many cities i want to visit there too and i think that i will have this opportunity soon and if i would say if or if we talk about dream house or a dream home i would really like to have i would prefer to have some little house somewhere in the mountains but i would like to be included also in swimming pool so i can enjoy my free time not only during the winter but also in the summer away from the crowd from the cities and yeah it will be nice in there many places to be visit here but also spain is good yes maybe portugal yeah portugal i have never been there you no i have not been there but this on my wishlist 0 hopefully we will go there soon yes and do you have for example any favorite place that you have already been that you can add like your favorite holiday ever sure venice number one i like that city so much i have been a couple of times and i realized that it is much more better if you go there during some working days from monday till friday actually not friday thursday and to go there at the early in the morning at sunrise that sounds nice thanks well i was in venice like i think 5 or 6 years ago yes i really liked the place but i think for now it will not be one of my favorite holidays because i did not have much time to walk through the city we were only for a day but i can say maybe my last holiday was here i like the everyday fashion because the young people are getting to dress more casual so it is very comfortable for a girl or a woman dressing in a skirt or a dress combined with some sneakers thank you once i have been in actually i have been twice in milan i like that city so much and i was there for the sales period so i used to buy so many things that were so much cheaper than here and it is very good that they were with high quality materials made where i love casual style especially sports style i do not like wearing heels maybe i have not worn them for years i really love wearing sneakers jeans and casual dresses everything and oversized clothes i do not like uncomfortable clothes and i really love shopping especially when there are sales because i do not want and i i also love to buy skin products i really enjoy and i love taking care of my skin especially in summer because it requires special treatments and maybe they are a little bit more expensive than some clothes but i think that the skin routine is the most important especially in those this that you want to go shopping yes i am always doing some shopping when it is summer or winter and when the sales start i do not like spending the whole summer price for one product because i can find cheaper i also like searching on the internet there are a lot of that is great well from thank you i do not usually wear them i prefer not to wear them most of the time because when i am doing sports i do not feel comfortable with the jewelry on me and i put very little makeup on i like cooking very much my mother is having some old book where she writes all the recipes she cooks those are all traditional meals but nova deniz i also use so much instagram and well i had meat and salad and some homemade cherries from my cherry tree in the yard tastes excellent i like cherries so much and also strawberries this is the perfect period for them and they are so good you know it is for the cherries i do not like when they are frozen but the strawberries i like to eat them when they are frozen can you repeat the last sentence because i did not hear well and here we are going to finish our conversation yeah sure so i like when i am eating frozen strawberries that is great i usually put them in a glass of wine and the strawberries are adding some special flavor to it i do not like frozen cherries because i do not think their date is good but for the strawberries i recommend you when they are frozen and you add to the wine but not only to the wine when you add to a sparkling water thank you like doing some good food which is not so greasy and which is healthy that is great do you know how to do it yes i prefer eating healthy food and i try to eat as more healthy than i can afford so okay that is great sharing new experiences and talking about our lives went really well in this conversation so i am going to wish you a nice day 0 thank you so much it was also a pleasure for me speaking to you i wish you a nice day as well do you have any plans for today well i think i am going to have a nap now and rest it weekend right 0 yes finally it is weekend we can rest a little bit longer as we were working all the time from monday till friday when it is saturday and sunday it is actual paradise for us going for a slow walk or doing some slow things it is very important when we can rest our bodies and our minds and not doing nothing yeah we have to remain all the time in the house yes i will go a little bit later outside too okay so thank you and goodbye thank you so much we will see you later so we can bye walk and continue our conversation outside bye bye bye (EDACC-C44-00)
hi my participant number is fc 52 p one hi my participant number is fc 52 p 2 when was the last time that you visited saint andrews not that long ago actually it was probably around a year ago or maybe less it was around about christmas time actually when i think about it just before christmas i absolutely love saint andrews i try and go at least twice a year do you remember we used to go when we were younger with mum and dad that is right i have got really fond memories of going there for holidays when we were younger the beach over there is amazing do you play golf there no i do not play golf anymore i used to when i was younger it is a very good course though and whenever you go up there there is all sorts of people from all different countries that travel far and wide to play there that is right it is world famous is not it what is the name of it again the old course the old course it is lovely i assume it has been there for a long time then yes i believe it has been there for some time yeah but it has got a lot of heritage surrounding it i believe it has been there for nearly 500 years at least wow since the beginning of golf i believe that is potentially where golf started in a lot of people is eyes that is amazing there is so many lovely golf courses around there is some really lovely ones up in dunbar i do not play golf myself but we have visited these places and i am sure it was dunbar it was a beautiful golf course right on the water absolutely stunning and like you say there was a lot of people from a lot of different countries that have traveled over specifically just to play golf at that particular course dunbar is a lovely place a lovely part of the world i love the east coast berwick etc berwick upon tweed north berwick all these places are lovely they really are i have been there north berwick i do not think i have been to berwick upon tweed but north berwick certainly is absolutely beautiful as well it is not too far away from where i live either so it is quite nice to even just go away for a day trip absolutely it seems a lot further than where it is though i agree because i believe it is not that far from england no no it is the way the way the country shaped effectively that england comes up further on the right hand side and as a result it is right next to berwick upon tweepe which is in england that is amazing really is not it yeah it is all these things that you do not realize i love all parts of scotland i love the north of scotland do you go there much well yes i went away last year we did the north coast 500 so we visited lots of different places there not as many as the last time when we did it though we did not feel the need to visit other places again although beautiful but with a wee one probably a bit too remote for what we need but absolutely beautiful is that a bit too much for robson well he is good at traveling the traveling is not the hard bit it is just more the remoteness you know when you have got a little one and you need something from a shop or whatever or children can be unpredictable sometimes so there needs absolutely their needs can be great and you need to sort of have things available to you and certain places when there is not things around for quite a while it does make things a bit difficult although beautiful scenery and lots of things to do historically but with a young child not as many to be fair but really nice to enjoy as an adult yeah just a wee bit too far away it is a place i have never been i have lived in scotland my whole life and i have never been to john 0 groats somewhere that i think it would be quite interesting to say that you have been though 0 absolutely it is you know we traveled from there back home we did it all in the one go and that was a long journey i am sure it was about 6 or 7 hours by the time we got home considering we would made so many stops on the way gradually traveling up but certainly going from there back home it was a very long journey so i would not recommend it for a day trip but definitely worth going to see no it is certainly not somewhere i would go for a day trip but i would love to be able to travel there and just visit it and say that i have been there is a lot of people that go from john 0 groats all the way down to the bottom of england to say that they have went from one end of britain to the other i think that would be a great trip absolutely i have seen people before that were doing the north coast 500 and they were cycling they were cycling amazing what people can do when they really test their endurance but certainly absolutely i am not sure if it was something i would be able to do to cycle at all because the terrain is difficult you know even in a car it is tricky absolutely it is getting a lot busier up there though i have heard stories that you are traveling along and there is lots of different cars parked at the side of the road etc well that is it when we did it before it was not that popular it was only just a new thing but since then it is gained a lot of attention so again lots of people travel from all over the world to come and see and quite rightfully so because scotland should be showing off like that it is absolutely exquisite some of the places you would not even think it was in scotland and we are really really lucky and blessed to have that in our own country well absolutely the people that work up there and businesses up there will be cashing in big time which fair enough i think it is absolutely great that they are getting the attention that they deserve well that is it these little towns unlike scotland and edinburgh and other big places other big cities they have a lot of tourism coming and going whereas these little towns they do not so i guess in a way it would be beneficial although i am not sure if the older generation would see it that way well perhaps not perhaps not a lot of the time prefer a quiet life however it is bringing more money to these little places and it is boosting the economy in general the north coast 500 is an unbelievable thing for scotland to have achieved and for them to be able to offer it to people that are going to come and visit here is just brilliant in my mind it definitely is there is a lot of different things that you can do there as well in terms of the traveling you know you can have you can travel and camp you can travel in a camper van you can stay in the local hotels or b bs which are usually very full so i reckon if you were going to do anything like that you would need to book it well in advance i do not think you could just turn up and expect to have availability 0 no no way certainly during the summer being able to secure any accommodation up near the north coast 500 during the summer would be almost impossible unless you booked well well well in advance i think definitely there is not very many of them as well because these little towns are small they do not have big hotels and it is usually just small b bs or airbnbs they are very popular nowadays so perhaps maybe more things like that that are self catering set up but people do not tend to stay in the same place for a very long time so it is probably quite suitable yeah i think so i think you might be right there being the idea i think you might find that people have larger houses up there and perhaps renting out a room or 2 and making a bit of money out of it i do not see why not either as long as they are quite happy to do that and the people are happy to stay there then it works for everybody i guess definitely i stayed in a few really nice airbnb is over the years and it seems to be really popular now i stayed in one and had them i went to edinburgh just last year with my friends that was really nice and i had access to an outdoor space as well okay sounds very good it was more of a upstairs downstairs flat i would say you know it had access to downstairs and upstairs and it was it was really really nice i am trying to remember what area it was in now of edinburgh but that was lovely and quite reasonable obviously when you look at it as a whole but when it was split up between 6 people it worked out very reasonable for the weekend as opposed to one week absolutely i can imagine edinburgh is absolutely lovely anyway a lot of the houses over there are 2nd to none in the architecture over in edinburgh i absolutely love it edinburgh really is a lovely place especially at christmas time i always think it is such a lovely place to be absolutely and i believe being from glasgow you are almost quite biased towards glasgow however personally i prefer edinburgh i would say i feel there is a better vibe over there it is a lot more relaxed atmosphere over there than in glasgow what about yourself i do really like edinburgh i love glasgow as well do not get me wrong but more recently when i have been into the city center it is changed there is a lot of shops and buildings that are unoccupied and for some reason it just gives off a bit of a kind of messy a messy feel to it i am not entirely sure why when i had been in just recently it had been a while since i had been yeah i think there is a lot of regeneration going on though and i think they are trying to improve the place generally because it has become you are right it has become quite stagnant i think they are trying to improve the place and regenerate the city center it seems to be an emphasis on food outlets and bars etc but i do not know if the developers are looking at it and saying well that is right and i know that they were making more access for the cycle lanes and things up there which i did notice when i was in the city center just maybe a couple of weeks ago now but i did notice a lot more people on bikes cycling down sucky hall street where the shops were and around all the people which i thought was just sort of encouraging the wrong things in my opinion having a little one that sort of adds to the sort of stress of the day absolutely and you need to have eyes in the back of your head for these things as well well absolutely in a normal instance cyclists are not really allowed on the pavement so there should be a bit of information out there for the city center and the shopping areas that people should not be on their bikes because it is not just the young children it is the elderly as well yeah and the issue is as well it needs to be more defined what is pedestrianized and what is for cyclists we obviously have cycle lanes popping up all over the city now which to be fair i think is great it encourages people to be healthier just as emissions however in pedestrianized areas such as glasgow city center you need to have it more defined so you do not have well definitely not because most people who are in there in the city center they are in there to use the shops they are not thinking about someone coming past them on a bike so i guess it is just down to common sense again the people on the bikes should be taking care but i could count at least 3 people going far too fast down the slope of sookiehall street which did not sit very well with me but certainly it is a good thing that they are bringing in more access the climate crisis yep i think the world is definitely going in the right direction in terms of education on the climate crisis i think educating is only part of it though and you need to actually ensure that action is being put into it i think cop 26 was a relative success i think that in reality politicians do understand the grave nature yes i completely agree with that there is a lot of factories producing a lot of harmful chemicals into the atmosphere so that certainly is something that needs to be looked at but yes as you see it is down to everybody to play their part now and i think certainly as you say about the education it is about educating the younger generation and how to look after our country and our environment in a way that it is going to no no if there was anything like recycling when we were younger it was on a very small level and then you wonder how long that has been going on for prior to us all the plastic production and all the other things that have been produced and just discarded these things do not break down they are not biodegradable so you do wonder then how long it will take for these things to you know how long it will take for the world to get on top of all that before then they move on to the next lot absolutely for younger people to start realizing that now they will be in the way of it so they will not know any different when it comes to them growing up and teaching their children so hopefully by then it will really really help but yes as you see it is down to every person as an individual to make that change little we will get there little by little hopefully bye i am home yes it is a tough one though because not everybody is willing to actually do it which makes it an issue but as you said this is all about educating the younger generation and making sure that they are under no illusions as to what is the right thing to do well that is right i am still in my main day anyway i agree because i really like the look of these new electric cars it is amazing how silent they are absolutely yeah it is really amazing and i know someone who has got a hybrid so that actually means that it can run on electricity and it can also run on petrol so you can flick between the 2 so technically that is really good in terms of for the environment absolutely do you think you will get an electric car eventually i think eventually yeah i think eventually most people will it is all about having the infrastructure at your home as well though and being able to ensure that having an electric or a hybrid works for yourself absolutely because i suppose once you do get that you would have to have a charger installed in your house so there is the sort of pro process of that as well is not there yeah and that is the thing people i am not saying everybody but i think there is certain people out there that do not think the wider picture of having an electric car and it still costs money to actually charge a car up etc and it just is an alternative to having a fuel at all that is true i would be interested to see how much it costs to charge up a car at home from your own energy usage would not that be interesting it would certainly with the energy prices going up it would to see if you could counterbalance it with the cost of diesel or petrol at the moment certainly i do not think it would be as much to have it fully charged because a full tank of diesel or petrol right now is astronomical the prices you will know that yourself absolutely i think that actually has a benefit to having an electric car nowadays certainly with the way fuel prices are going definitely it must be more cost effective in the long term i suppose it is a bit like the solar panels on your house initially they would be a big outlay in terms of cost but then over time it would balance itself out because you would be regenerating that money back in terms of paying for it through energy bills yeah yeah absolutely i think it is a i do genuinely think it is a great idea having electric cars a lot to put against it and as you said earlier on sorry the noise and how quiet it is etc a lot of companies try to develop specific noises so that people can hear them coming etc that is it it is amazing how quiet i just could not get over i actually got a fright because one came up behind me in a multi story car park and i genuinely did not hear it and i got a fright because i just was not expecting it so i suppose in a way that is really good but in a way it will take a lot of time to get used to that i think certainly for the older generation again you know 0 absolutely it is probably easier for the younger generation like us to understand the needs behind it etc but we are going to have a generation of current children growing up with electric cars and not knowing any different this is true remember when we were young we used to think about flying cars by this time the 2000s there was going to be flying cars and all these different ideas that were floating around i would not be surprised if that exactly i would not be surprised if that was going to be a real thing in a good few years time i am sure it will eventually i do not doubt for one minute somewhere in the world you can probably get a flying car probably will be there will be a prototype somewhere no doubt yeah i have certainly not seen one no (EDACC-C46_P1)
hi my participant number is fc 52 p one hello my participant number is fc 52 p 2 please call stella ask her to bring these things with her from the store 6 spoons of fresh snow peas 5 thick slabs of blue cheese and maybe a snack for her brother bob we also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog so when you were growing up what was your favorite game to play i actually enjoyed when we used to play hide and seek up near the moors there was a lot of space to run about there was a lot of hiding places and we obviously knew the area do you remember when mum used to take us up there and let us run about mad that is right it is such an open space up there and there is so many trees and really cool hiding places as you say i remember playing down by the burn do you remember that little bridge yes i do remember the bridge the little stone one what a lovely place that was that is right we used to throw the stones in and see who could throw the furthest over to the other side that is right i remember that that little burn caused many a havoc in our family i think i know i think that is still there to this day although there was a lot of flooding up there recently so i am not too sure how stable it is because i remember back then it was always a bit old and worn so hopefully it is still there i must go up there and see what other games did you like to play just like swimming in the wake up there that is right that lake is beautiful up there i remember we used to jump in as well that is right it was never too deep though never too deep that you could not enjoy walking about in it etc no that is true i do ever remember when we got the little fishing rods and we caught those tiny little fish that had stripes on them that is right were they not baby tadpoles no i think that was another time we caught little fish and they were sort of a silvery kind of brown color they were not much bigger than your pinky finger i am not sure if you will remember that it was quite a while ago yeah i think i do remember that mum used to let us look at them for a while and then throw them back in the water that is right we did not ever want to keep them well we did want to keep them as pets but mum would always say it is much kinder to throw them back in that is right do you remember we used to play football up there i do that is right and we used to use that big oak tree as the goals that is right i think people still use that up there though i have seen people recently up there playing football and they play exactly the way we did almost 20 years ago that is amazing is not it the same space it is still used the same way but we have such fond memories growing up there and lots of generations will probably be the same absolutely it was probably used exactly the same long before us as well this is true it is nice to know that they are preserving that area and not actually building any houses on it well not yet anyway no well i think part of it is protected i am sure it is so hopefully they will not move on to that part necessarily but i know that there was a lot of work going on up there to do with scottish water that is right i have seen that recently a lot of pipes going in that is right i think it is to do with the waterworks actually up at near 100 clock ah yes i know where that is yeah well hopefully they get it sorted soon and they can leave it alone again well that is such a beautiful space update anyway talking of beautiful spaces have you got anything booked for your holiday this year yes i am going to spain what about yourself lovely yeah we are going away to spain also but we are not going until the end of the year really we have got friends over there so we are going to visit them for christmas whereabouts is it you are going in spain good to alicante for 2 weeks that is great that is lovely there i have heard it is really really nice i have not been myself but i have heard it is beautiful and i have seen pictures have you been before yeah i have been before they have got lovely beaches over there you always get a good deal too did you get a good deal yeah yeah got a good deal 2 weeks all inclusive in alicante what about yourself are you staying with friends we are yes our flights were quite expensive though but i think that is because of the time of year that we are going i would not have thought that they would have been that expensive but we were talking about £600 for a week so quite a lot considering it is only for the flights £600 for flights that is quite interesting as just for 2 people so ah there is ropes in nogueng mathy no he is going to be staying with his grandparents ah lucky him that is it we are going to have christmas all together and then afterwards we are going over to see our friends for a while so it has been about 4 years since we have seen them so it will be really nice to get to know them that is long overdue yes it will be really nice to get over there and see them who is it that is going away with you is it just you and moira yeah yeah me and moira it will be a good time i am looking forward to it it has been a long time since we went away i think when the last time we went was before covid i was trying to work that out there that is a shame i think a lot of people are in that boat as well you know they have not been able to get away because of covid and various different reasons with work and whatnot so a lot of people are really happy to be getting away again this year it makes a big difference to how you feel when you have got something like that to look forward to does not it 0 absolutely it changes your mindset completely i always want to have holidays booked we have had this alicante holiday booked for some time but i think going forward we are probably going to make sure that we have at least one holiday booked to look forward to i have seen the covid rates are going up again this week but hopefully that is just a blip in the road and we can continue on as normal absolutely i think it is going to be a bit like that you know throughout the year it probably will peak and then start to drop down again i guess it just depends on what different people are up to you know lots of people are traveling again lots of people together for the jubilee so i think it just depends on the circumstances for certain people throughout the months does not it no i do not know anything about it it is so hard to keep a track of it sometimes i do not doubt though that if it was to affect me i would find out and do the right thing absolutely do you remember that book that grandma used to read to us when we were young called the magic porridge pot yes i do a brilliant book i got a great scottish book into the bargain but she used to read it so well what a brilliant book that was it was i tried to find it recently at the library when i was there and i could not find it i asked at the desk and they did not actually know which one i was talking about and i was trying to explain it and the storyline i knew it really well actually when i was thinking about it but i did have a look on amazon and it is there so i have ordered it and it should be here in a couple of days but it was funny because i remember absolutely obviously there was 5 years between us so you will remember certain things that i will not remember as much but i do remember the magic porridge pot getting read to us and gran was such a great storyteller her and grandpa to be honest but she certainly could read a book to us and keep us captivated that is that i am really looking forward to getting it because it will give me some really nice memories of them yeah i will be able to it is a nostalgia as well is not it and the thing is as well you can read it to robson and obviously then it becomes almost passed down the family as such well that is it i can try and recreate it the way that she used to tell it to us with all the wee voices and things yeah he would be doing well to be as good as his grandma though well that is true well experience experience is a bliss i guess yep all about just learning these things and you know these wee books are things that stay in your memory i guess and do not get me wrong it is not something that i routinely remembered but when you mentioned it there i knew straight away what you were talking about it is interesting is not it because i have not noticed that they have made a cartoon of it quite a lot of the old fairy tales have all been made into cartoons but that one is never been made into a cartoon and it is such a nice little story so it would be so nice to be able to watch it as well yeah no i would absolutely be nice obviously if you have children i am not so sure it has a great selling point other than scotland though you might be something that you could consider making up here but i am not sure how popular it is out west scotland as a story that is a fair point actually thinking about it i did notice that they are remaking the movie of the little mermaid did you see that 0 really is it a disney production i think it might be but it looks like it might be in real life you know more kind of real life as opposed to animated ah yeah disney are going in a very different direction i think they are kind of moving away from the animated side of things certainly being absolutely animated they are starting to move away and diversify their films a wee bit that has been the last sort of decade or so they have been doing that absolutely it is quite interesting though how they are remaking these things and sort of bringing it into a new era it is quite good i have not seen yeah i have not seen the beauty and the beast i know that they remade that i have never watched that or the lion king actually i have not seen them no neither have i moira went to see the beauty and the beast said it was very good 0 really i was the one with emma watson was not it okay no i have not had the time to watch them yet but it is definitely something that i should watch because i love that film as a young child absolutely love that do you remember we used to watch every single week more or less homeward bound that is right and i think with that movie it was really different for us because the animals talked remember so we sort of used to think that animals really could talk and it was that sort of wonder of how did they make the animals do that you know it was i love that that is right yeah we even named our cat after the cat remember hold on to the camera sassy yes that is right she was a great cat can you believe she was 22 when she died wow that is old my cat that i had just sadly recently had to be put down and she lived to 14 so to think that she was a whole 8 years older than her is crazy because sydney was really old she showed her age quite quickly you know after a while she was you could tell that she was old she just was not as sprightly as she used to be quickly for cats i believe that is right they can their health can rapidly decline sadly and it is a shame do you have any pets i did have a dog however he also passed away unfortunately he was only young he was not even 3 years old and he suffered from epilepsy he suffered very badly from it and he was medicated appropriately however unfortunately he could not really live any longer and he was suffering of course that is such a shame i am really sorry to hear that i am sure he had a very good life despite his health issues though i think he made the most of it we tried to take him as many places as we could and give him everything that he wanted certainly not a dog can want anything but things that we think that he would like we tried to give him but unfortunately that is just life sometimes is not it that is right do you think you would get another pet i think in due course we will possibly it is tough right now because he obviously has you know it was only 4 or 5 months ago that he passed away and you know he leaves such a void but what can you do you know you need to move on at some point maybe one day we will get another dog i am not sure i am not sure sure in terms of me with my cat i mean we obviously had her for 14 years since she was a baby and like we said before her health did rapidly decline quite quickly once we found out that she was unwell so we knew it was the right thing to do is to send her to sleep which was like you not an easy thing at all because you do not want to lose your pet but you have to look at it from their point of view and what kind absolutely they play such a massive part in your life i think you are almost kind of oblivious to that until you know they are not there anymore and you realize at the time when you are looking after them that they are such a massive part of your life but then when they are not there you realize just how big a part of your life they are it is really difficult sometimes i think when they are not there either that is right they do they are part of the family and when they are in your life for so long you just get so used to them being there so when they are not it takes such a bit of adjustment to get used to that well that is it exactly on to happier things have you tried any new recipes recently i have actually i tried a really nice spanish potato and should use a dish recently is that something that you like well that sounds really nice what do you put in it other than the main ingredients so i do not know if you have done this before but slow cooked chorizo is actually really really nice it is you know sometimes when you cook it it can become a little bit tough yeah yeah so i slow cooked it with a tomato based sauce with onions and garlic smoked paprika and then i did the potatoes separately i chopped them all up part boiled them and then sprayed them with the fry light it is a bit healthier seasoning and put them in the oven and slow cooked the chorizo mixture on low for maybe around 3 hours or so yeah and it sounds healthy as well actually yeah it sounds really nice sounds like something i would eat actually tell me something did you cook the whole chorizo as a whole or did you cut it up before you slow cooked it so i chopped it up but i did not chop it up too small because i did not want it to sort of what would be the word go a bit tough you know sometimes when you have the chorizo it can do that so the bigger you leave it the softer it becomes okay yeah that makes sense i guess so is it just a whole chelitzo you put in that is right just chop it up maybe about 2 centimeters something like that into 2 centimeter pieces and then just pop it in with the tomato mixture honestly it was really really nice it was quite filling as well so i am almost trying to thanks yeah i am always trying to find new recipes when it comes to this time of year because i do not always feel like really big heavy meals you will probably be the same i know absolutely the last thing you want is a steak pie or something like that you want to have something that is quite light and easy to eat especially with the rising temperatures recently it is not easy to have such an appetite especially when it is more humid etc you would probably rather go for a mediterranean diet funnily enough that is right what kind of recipes have you been making recently well you know yourself i do not make a lot of things moira tends to cook in this house but really she made a nice tikka pasta recently all right nice actually it was roast chicken with tikka through it and then other spices etc but it was like a cream based pasta so it was not too heavy though it was quite nice and especially the way it was made but yeah i just love pasta i could live on pasta really yeah same here i do love pasta i have ever told you about the recipe that i make and it is with the balsamic glaze so it is more like a sort of it is not like really saucy but it is more of a coating for the pasta and it is made with the balsamic glaze that is really nice it is really light as well and not very many you have not told me about that no not very many ingredients i actually used to always go to la vita restaurant and that was the pasta i would always get so i decided to try and recreate it during lockdown last year because we were not able to get there so ah very nice yeah i found all the ingredients sun dried tomatoes mushrooms good quality pancetta smoked or unsmoked whatever you prefer absolutely toasted peanuts and what was aunt pasta called again nona pasta ah and what was in it again was there any meat in it or was it just vegetarian it was a good quality pancetta put that in it is really simple actually it is really really simple some garlic cook it all off and add it all together the balsamic glaze works a lot better than the balsamic vinegar because that is just a bit too wet it is too much liquid you would have to try and 0 absolutely picking it up a bit it is quite interesting it is quite interesting it sounds very nice actually it is it is lovely once you try it you will be making it all the time because as i say it is really really fresh and really light and it is not too heavy because sometimes pastas can be a bit stodgy you know like macaroni cheese absolutely love that but it can just be so filling and heavy yeah have you ever tried the macaroni cheese from sugil sugul and the toon yep no no no i have not tried strangely enough i have never been to sugo i absolutely love pezzano but i have never been to sugo wow you should definitely go they have all fresh made pasta it is delicious you love pasta thanks for having me if you love pasta you will love it there absolutely i have heard great things about it i have heard that ragu is very good as well actually i do not think i have tried that from there but it has been a while since i have had a ragout i do really like that it is very good it is really nice from there we could try and get to sugil at some point you should definitely it has really good reviews as well i have not been to the pizza place though like you say is it cassano did you say yes there is one in the town and there is one in the west end as well love life it is very good it is very you make it obviously fresh for you and it is lovely 0 good all sorts of different toppings on it etc and you can obviously mix and match and add things to it and take things off etc it is lovely very nice can you choose the different bases or is it all the same no no it is just i think it is proven sourdough over like 48 hours or something like that but the base is so good honestly you would not want any other base if you tried this wow definitely something i will try then you try the pasta one i will try the pizza one i will let you know how it goes absolutely he is a macaroni there it is really really nice it is really really nice i believe it is 5 different cheeses so it is really cheesy as you can imagine okay yeah i can not imagine (EDACC-C46_P2)
hi my participant number is fc 36 p one my passage that i will read to you now is please call stella ask her to bring these things with her from the store 6 spoons of fresh snow peas hi my participant number is fc 36 p 2 and the passage reads so here is our conversation i was thinking we should talk about food since i know that we both like food what are some of your favorite foods i do not have specific favorite foods i have favorite countries or foods so like indian of course italian and i am going through a bit of a japanese phase at the moment how about you yeah i do not think my mom cooked too much indian food when i was growing up it was very western food so i do enjoy eating a curry when i go out i also like italian food of course pizzas pastas sometimes when we feel like eating unhealthy though we like to eat some american style takeout like burgers and those sort of things chicken is always good but i do love a steak from time to time and of course potato like a baked doing like a baked potato on the coals on the barbecue okay that is nice and how do you like your steak well we do a marinade like it is called for short sow so soy sauce olive oil and was waster show source yeah and we marinate it in that it is pretty good yeah okay i believe it makes it quite tender and soft in done no you and you like it medium medium rare or just rare medium more medium yeah not so much juice okay interesting and what do you do on the brine it is that i like lamb choppies or lamb chops they call them i do not know if choppies is probably as the african word but yeah i like lamb chops in the braai chicken is also very nice of recent i have been into a chicken on the braai and we do this type of sausage here which we call bourrevoise which is a type of beef sausage but it is long and cut and heavily spiced yes lots of spices in it i do not know what is what is the put coriander on garlic those sort of spices some even put chili in it yeah so that is quite nice on a braai we also enjoy oxtail but that has to be cooked too long it is like a stew on a braai but that is like it has to be about 3 hours or so 4 you it is a whole day thing to cook oxtail i was just thinking when you were a child were there any foods that you did not like eating as a child that you eat now what sort of foods have it has been a pleasure like eating as a child so as a child well even now my family never cooked a lot of like offal kind of stuff so kidneys livers that sort of thing we did not eat mutton or lamb either just because and that yeah that is something i have never been able to acquire a taste for okay interesting you know with me i think i did not really like mushrooms as a child but now i have recently started eating mushrooms prawns as well i did not like it too much as a child i think to look look of them the look of them kind of put you off but now yeah now they you find out they are delicious i love mushrooms what sort of dish do you like with mushrooms pasta dishes on pizza is very nice even stuffed mushrooms that is also very nice you stuff them with cheese and think breadcrumbs they use breadcrumbs so did you grow up by the ocean that you had prawns as a child or were shown prawns as a child yeah i grew up on a coastal town so they fish was guys would sell fish on the side of the road on the weekends and so there will be a fish market and every saturday my father used to go and buy fish fresh fish yeah very different to where i live now i am quite inland so there is not much yeah i grew up all over but mostly inland in south africa and then a little bit lived a little bit on the coast but i have never enjoyed fish that is something that i struggle to eat it is too fishy yeah okay except prawns i can handle prawns yeah what about hey cakes not too bad it is not too fishy yeah hakes hakes okay okay and i think it is finding bones as well that is interesting that puts you off yeah i remember those kids in school used to bring their sandwiches which used to be tin fish and just have the bones in it and everything and they just used to eat it just like that with of that taking out the birds apparently they are soft but anyway that is a bit gross eh and are you are a good cook yeah i would say so in high school we had what was home economics so part of that was practical cooking and so in the final year of high school i got the highest marks for the practical aspect of the subject shum for the for the grade the theoretical i was not too good with but but the practical i got the highest mark for yeah what was it do you have that subject in school yeah but only the girls took it girls with yeah so it was just girls to collect something it was called home economics what was the project that you had to make or the dish that you had to make for your where you scored your high marks well it was throughout the year so it was different things made for the different aspects of cooking so it could be like if it was confectionery so it could be marshmallows or honeycomb or sugar sweets so it was throughout mark is gotten throughout the year for all the different what a sugar sweet sugar sweets like a sparkle like ah so what are they called what are they called it is like those menthol sweets that we used to get you are sugar sweet they call them something else pot still do not pot stalled i can not remember now i have no idea some research on that and would you ever think of becoming a vegetarian have you ever tried it yeah for a few months maybe 6 months or so went vegetarian and how did it go it went well it just requires a lot more planning and like thinking out of the box it is much easier to prepare a meat and to veg kind of meal than it is to prepare vegetarian meal so it just requires a lot more planning and thinking which you do not always have time to do that know and also people think you save money by eating vegetables the price of vegetables are actually the same price as meat things are expensive yeah and what about you do you not come from a vegetarian background heritage yeah they were supposed to be vegetarian but they never practiced it i do not think any of that family on my side actually practice the vegetarian traditions it is hard to be a vegetarian in south africa because the meat is so good here and i did try to be a vegetarian once when i saw this thing on the truly elephants being abused i was on tv it was a documentary and then in protest i was for a month i did not eat vegetables so yeah that is vegetarian being a vegetarian is quite hard took your stand it was terrible how they were beating them because they had to beat them in the training them you it was terrible and do you eat a meal every day like all 3 meals like breakfast lunch supper or do you skip meals no i eat all 3 meals i am not a not a huge snacker so i stick to the 3 meals a day and what do you like for breakfast there breakfast is pretty simple just a big mug of coffee and some toast with peanut butter okay sounds good and lunch whatever is going if there is leftovers or sandwich you do not care too much about lunch no it is not breakfast and lunch are not important meals in my opinion supper or dinner is the most important meal and how many cups of coffee then do you have just 11 cup of coffee and then a cup of tea in the afternoon and then some herbal tea at night okay and what sort of tea do you like in the in the for your 2nd cup i mean you are the one after coffee so we have 5 roses tea it is just like a normal salon tea black tea black bulls is tea yeah i like it is a good strong cup of tea okay and then with tea do you have a biscuit or something like a hobnob i do not often keep biscuits at home but if i have baked something then yeah i would have something with it huh what is your favorite biscuit you obviously a fan i like jaffa cakes they are hard to find though because i think they are imported we have our own brand here who makes that chair on the supermarket pick and pay 0 okay has their own brand and then romany creams and lice bakers bake is it oats or what i do not know what it is made with oats chocolate so and then what about a chocolate digestive you know i was not too much into those digestives here not too much into digestive i like it is the shortbread style ones the eat samosa i think this was it scottish shortbread what do they call it i do not know what the official name yeah yeah shortbread yeah and so you do not have cereals you do not like cereals in the morning no i have not your cereals i stopped eating when i was a kid and then i stopped eating breakfast altogether i have never been a breakfast eater i just could not eat anything in the mornings before like 11 or 12 so i had to force myself to start eating in the mornings yeah and what is your wherever you live and stuff well what is your favorite restaurant at the moment do you like going out to restaurants yeah sometimes it can be a bit disappointing because sometimes you can do better at home yourself what is a favorite restaurant at the moment we have a restaurant by us that does a monday night burger special so you buy one and get one free so i am pretty partial to a good deal okay yeah the buy one get one free that is always a good deal it is always a winner are there any like indian restaurants by you there is one but i have never i have not tried it yet okay chinese no no chinese french yes there is a lady in the town that is a french baker she is from the reunion island so she makes french pastries and stuff that is that is pretty good i was going to ask you about so the burger special that is a good one buy one get one free have you so what did you have for dinner today pasta you just like a pasta dish yeah and you yeah i had also pasta dish and but with pork sausages yeah so that was quite nice interesting so did your mom teach you to cook or your dad no not really so much my dad never cooked my mom she did cook but she did not teach me really but when i got older i realized i needed to learn so then i started learning yeah so now i enjoy it i enjoy cooking so is that something culturally would a mom teach a son an indian mother teach her son to cook or not really no it is not really socially acceptable because it is quite a society where the woman is expected to cook so that is a problem because i was a high school teacher so i used to tell my kids all the guys especially i used to say to them you must learn how to cook because you can impress a girl so what grades did you teach i taught grades 8 to 12 so that is 12 is like my trick which is the final year of high school so yeah i taught english literature so it was novels and poetry shakespeare the usual stuff yeah i love you which the kids hated and what movies did you do for film study we did life of pi which was quite an interesting movie yeah and then the crucible i do not know if you watched that one about those girls who you who accuse all those people of being riches it was quite an interesting one i am trying to think now but the shakespeare is always showed them movies because they battle to understand so we showed them like hamlet and they loved hamlet for some reason because i think it just starts off with killings and murders and bloodshed so the kids love that them and what was your favorite book in school that you did i did we did a lot of south african literature well so in the last year of high school i did a book called shades what is that about can you remember i do not think we do that in our school i think it was about a white family a white kid that grows up and befriends a black child that works on the farm so it was all most of the literature that we had got in school was around that sort of topic because of apartheid you so yeah that was yeah what it was about shades you also we also did you lord of the flies 0 that is good the kids like that one especially the boys they can imagine that happening being an english teacher or you an avid reader not really i enjoy movies more than books yeah so definitely watching movies i always told the kids i was an avid reader just to make them read but it was actually an untruth so what movies do you enjoy watching sci fi you know star wars star trek yeah sci fi but i like offbeat like dark sci fi you know and it is not so happy and then i like thrillers and who done it murder mysteries yeah and you are also murder mystery kind of ones any detective crime solving shows your documentaries i like documentaries not a big fan of sci fi or fantasy kind of movies ok but sometimes it is also good just to watch a comedy or romantic comedy something that is a bit like mind numbing so you do not have to put much thought into what you are watching so i call it chewing gum for the eyes you so it is like chewing gum for the eyes so you just watch it with that thank you what is your last british series that you really enjoyed i think you were telling me once about the lion of duty 0 yes yeah line of duty was very gripping british series are a lot more gripping than american series yeah they are and i like i like it yeah the ones where you have to just like stay up and watch the entire season know you have to binge but the nice thing is but british ones as well they only make 4 or 5 episodes you some american series are like 18 go on and on like lost that series yeah and did you have any pets growing up many so our 1st pet was so we have always had dogs cats my mom became a bit of a collector of cats so she would any cat that she would find strays she would come home with so we had a lot of cats and hamsters what is the other name for us a rock drop better rock higher rock yeah so we had that and then i hand reared a mongoose yeah  you what is the mongus is name monkey very and what type of what you know what species it was a slender mongoose so it is like very long thin body long tail and like a rusty rusty kind of color fur and what happened to monkey well it was we found my parents found it its mom had been chased off by a dog and they waited for the mom to bring it back to come back and get it she did not so we hand it had injured its back leg so we kept it in an old hamster cage until and fed it until it got stronger we released it but it just yeah shame fair day and how long did you have the monkey for yeah it must have been about 3 or 43 must have been maybe 4 or 5 years okay we just got a message from zoom meeting will end in 9 minutes 9 minutes okay so that is your set and so did you have pets yeah i was always dogs was never anything so exotic like yours kits no i did not like it not a cat person yeah what about are you just do you still feel have you never been around cats you have one kind of adopted us which we grew close to but you are definitely not by choice getting a cat yeah i would like you to have a dog again but the area where i live does not allow dogs we are watching that have you seen those videos on yeah it is you can see in a lot of the videos the owners like it making their own interpretation of what what buttons the dog has pressed this far easier ways to communicate i mean animals do not communicate in words obviously  so yeah there is other ways of communicating with your pets than getting them to press buttons and trying to humanize what you think they are thinking yeah i think it is just the tone that you say so that you give instructions in it is not so much the words yeah strange people so how come what area do you stay in that you can not have pets well it is also quite a rural area and the problem is they have leopards here and other wild animals so we can not have a pet because it will be the leopards lunch or supper and there is no fences as well to protect your wild animals i mean your domestic pets from your  that is what people think about africa when they think about it they think lions are just walking around and they actually are but they have electric fences to protect certain areas yeah it would be nice to have pets again so how long have you lived where you are currently 3 years now 3 years yeah so i was on the coast and i have moved inland so you know it is quite a nice little town very small town it is one of these you called it a 11 what is it one horse town bye so there is not much to do lots of foreigners yeah we have pretty cheers yeah tourists that is because it is close to one of the big safari park kind of thing and then the area where we live we have made friends with some british american families yeah so that is quite a mix of people here so which safari park is it nearest it is called the kruger national park so it is quite a famous one i think whenever someone comes to south africa they have to go to the kruger national park and do you go often yeah i like to go at least once a month it is about an hour maybe but the problem is petrol is getting so expensive because of the world conditions at the moment so yeah we may have to even limit traveling once a month because you use a lot of petrol because you are pretty much just driving the whole day  you can even do sometimes like 500 keys or something in there you 500 kilometers not miles just looking for animals so do you miss the coast yes i miss my friends at the coast i think there was more to do socially at the coast although this area is quite beautiful with nature i think there is a lot of more interesting restaurants more things to do more friends that sort of thing so i miss that aspect of the coast it is also nice to know bye lots of our friends were affected as well by that and lots of people died there so they have not been having a really great time there you you are so and what about work wise what did you do for work so i studied interior design and then i went into law related field so i was battling to get work in the interior design field so i started out working for a law firm so it was specializing in property law and i did that for 10 or 12 years and then i left work and i focused interesting and how is that business going yeah it is doing much better with the covid and lockdowns and everything people were not it was mainly weddings that we did so people were not getting married you but as soon as that lifted then it went back to normal so yeah it is doing pretty well interesting so covid had a effect on that so in the area i live as well because it is based on tourism well that is their primary source of income now people are game ranges things a lot of companies closed down here during covid so covid really had a negative effect on people here  so yeah that is quite tragic so a lot of these nice businesses had to close down i think we got one minute maybe we should end it and start again kel speak to you just now thank you (EDACC-C43_P1)
okay okay so hi my name is fc 59 p 2 please call stella ask her to bring these things with her from the store 6 spoons of fresh snow peas 5 thick slabs of blue cheese and maybe a snack for her brother

better bob we also need a small plastic snake and the big toy frog for the kids she can scoop these things into 3 dried bags and we will go meet her wednesday at the train station there you go great great okay i like your accent you have a british accent really actually i think my accent changed a lot throughout the years because at 1st i was studying in english in the university and so i thought that was my best moment in english and then when i went back to living home you know i am surrounded by native speakers of my own language and so i feel like my english actually has worsened a lot so thank you i am so sorry yeah but i still try to watch a lot of movies in all the languages i speak so that i try to keep it up you know because i am always worried you know it is so easy i think to forget the language and so you always have to try to keep it going on somehow and so i just watch a lot of netflix i guess yeah and do you speak with other people in english no not at all like not at all it is just you know sometimes i texted my friends like international friends from uni or whatever and so that is the only time i get to speak english or maybe when i am traveling but that is not very often nowadays so yeah but i yeah this is why i am not practicing as much as i would like to and so just passive earing so there is that i see bye and did you you said you you went to malta yes on holiday thank you when when was it last month i think so i think it was last month it was in may now it is in june so like yeah roughly last month but that was lovely and their people spoke perfect english even though that is not their 1st language i think their 1st language is maltese it is a weird combination of arab and italian and spanish so that is a weird language but they do speak very nice english no not for sure you i think that is time thanks for watching when i went on holiday was in 2019 no well i went to the beach in 2020 but it was just for a day i have not been on holiday so when you that is bad we can go somewhere together yeah we can arrange it when you went to malta did they ask you for a vaccination passport or anything like that i think one month ago it was yes you had to compile like a file which is i do not remember the name but it is a thing that you have to do every time you travel anywhere in the european union staking like what is the state of your vaccination and saying how it works like where are you going basically so just to track it and and then to go on the plane actually you had to be vaccinated but that is not a thing anymore i am not sure now i am pretty sure you do not have to wear a mask on the plane anymore so there is that but i am not sure what is like if you have to be vaccinated to fly or something i have no idea of anything anymore so this form that you have to fill in is it an online form yeah it is an online form it is from the website of the european union and it is called something like a passenger location form that is the name and like if you are going anywhere in the european union you just fill this thing up and that is just for the european union to know where you are and what is your vaccination status i think i am not sure okay but do you they do not ask you they do not ask you to approve of this form when you board the plane or when you have to buy the ticket no they do not die they are 2 separate things you have to do this thing i do not know why they tell you like if you go on the website of the playing company they tell you please fill this form at this link but no one checked this but even in the worst period of covid like you had to fill so many forms but no one checked anything i remember so when covid hit i was living abroad and i had to go bye bye anyway yeah so where would you like to go next on vacation i saw a €71 flight to baleares so there is that if you want to come with me you so or you no i just saw it i have not bought it yet because the thing is all the old and i was like €70 but i mean but all the hotels are fucking it up sorry the language is so expensive is it in spain yeah it is like the balearic islands not the ones in the in the atlantic ocean the one in the mediterranean you yeah i think they are under like barcelona or something yeah in that area between anyways spain and morocco and that seems to be pretty but like the hotels are really really really expensive and so what is the point of spending just €70 for the flight but then you are going to spend so much i am talking €600 for the shittiest for a very bad hostel so that is a lot what bye for how many nights like okay one week but that is like €600 for a bad hostel i mean wow i am not spending that kind of money you with other 6 people i can do that for free you know what i am saying anyway so yeah i am lowkey looking for a different i do not know what you mean i am kidding i am just kidding you anyway yeah yeah so that is that is i was actually my sister god bless her like and i was like 0 you know i saw this crazy cheap flight i want to buy it and she was like yeah but check the hotels 1st they are going to be so expensive it is baleares in july and i was like nah and i go check the hotels i was like 0 it is bad so yeah i am sorry i am still looking at the flat and i actually i lowkey moved a work thing i had to do because so badly i wanted to take the flight so now the work thing is moved and i still have not found a hotel and so i do not know do you have an exhibition no i have a workshop i am making like a cycle of workshop actually tonight already i have the 1st workshop and then every saturday for like 5 weeks i am making one in yeah so doing that 0 nice so how many people are in this workshop thank you so are you hosting the workshop yeah yeah yeah not in my place but i am going to be a guest in a shop and in this actually this is the place where i did my exhibition and so i will be a guest and i will hold the workshop at their place and i will you know i just talk about you know teach things and talk about work and today it is 3 people so we are low key hoping for bigger numbers but yeah i mean we were aiming for like 78 so thank you actually last week the very 1st workshop was actually last week but it got canceled because there were not enough actually there were 2 people and i said i was going to do it but then one of the 2 people bailed it was only one person bye bye but this is the one part how do they promote this event on social media at their shop but i think these people i do not know they are also getting the thing is i am collaborating for work with a lot of people that are starting just like me and so the thing that is hard with this thing is that we are all trying to get each other visibility but that is not how it works but but these other people also are still relatively unknown so if 3 pages i do not know on instagram with 1000 followers each promote each other it is still 3000 followers which is not a lot and you know you have you end social media you need big numbers in order to achieve i do not know real engagement because like if 3000 people sees that like i see it is annoying to be struggling about these things because they are not important things you know what i am saying like having to worry about the follower count it is just something sterile it is not something that is just boring but the thing is it actually changes things in the work because if the majority of your work comes from instagram like having a high follower count actually will change things i see when i was living in florence i was working for a restaurant that they used to do cooking courses yeah so they use the airbnb to promote this course thank you yes because on airbnb there is a section called experiences so so also the host can organize these events and then can do very different things for example guided tours or cooking classes or wine tasting and they are very popular especially because the target of airbnb is local people who are traveling in locations so you can promote your business in the local area i am dead yeah people that are interested in things to do in that area so i mean i am talking about the workshops maybe you can think about also the channel i do not know if they probably charge you a percentage of how much you charge so i remember  yeah but it is just a way to have you know some i do not know some reviews or any anyway just people that come to your workshop yeah something like that that could be an idea also couch surfing surfing also couchsurfing yeah you can promote like an event on an event i think actually airbnb works best because the kind of tourism that is developing in my area right now i do not think it is couch surfing tourism i think right now we are having a lot of like you know well not supposed to say the name of the countries but neighboring countries you know what those are and like the richer ones ok and and so this is like a thanks and that is actually very interesting but maybe i will check that one too because actually i have been working also with the tourism office but honestly they have been kind of useless yeah the thing i learned is that if you want to promote something go to the authorities because you have to do that but do not expect them to actually do something because 90% of the time the authorities the official channels or whatever they are going to be useless i do not know what they are paying them for but anyway working with private organizations yeah you are welcome so what else what am i doing tonight at the workshop well we already talked about that 0 yesterday was my sister is birthday party so we had pizza and our grandmas came over and we had dinner and i 0 did i tell you this is a tragic news did i tell you i think i told you i am lactose intolerant what does it mean i cannot eat mozzarella anymore ah what how do you know 0 because i was feeling sick every time i ate cheese actually i did not know right it took a lot of time because at 1st i thought it was just a stressful period and you know some people you know when they are stressed they have headaches and i always was the kind of person when it is stressed gets a little bit sick in the stomach but then this thing kept going and so i was like ok maybe i should see you and so i realized it was the cheese and so i cannot eat any more cheese or milk and that is a hassle because like you cannot imagine no one has lactose free mozzarella like all the supermarkets have it they all have it it is super common but the restaurants do not so like you are going to go to a restaurant and you are like 0 do you have lactose free mozzarella well i do not like cheese jesus so it is not going to be a problem for me you just do not eat mozzarella i do not like cheese but i do eat pizza i like pizza but i do not eat pizza mozzarella the regular one i do not but i do not yes i do not i do not eat cheese i do not eat parmesan cheese i do not eat other kind of cheese i do not just do not like it that is always confusing to me because if you remember when i 1st met you you were in your i think vegan phase so i just kind of got used to the idea of you were vegan and then several years later you were like no actually i eat meat and then i feel like i can never keep track because i changed my hair i know you told me but and then and then now like i learned that you do not eat cheese but it is no it is just i do not like cheese yeah but it is still crazy because like how do not you like cheese i just say goodbye to my uncle he came from the country i was born thank you yeah he left i think he left today you he came here with my aunt and they came here and visit because my my granddad is not very it is not very well and so they wanted yeah so the they wanted to say goodbye to him and yeah i grew up with him well i did not grow up i stayed with him for about a year when i was 7 okay so i spent a lot of time with him he taught me how to play chess yeah yeah i was a bit sad to say goodbye he is a very nice person i will see you he is a painter and also a teacher a painter yeah i never knew that what does he paint he paints mostly surrealistic things  the main theme is erotic scenes okay but not erotic just no not erotic just he paints a lot of women but okay just the shape you know it is not a very detailed face okay yeah that is interesting actually that is very interesting you from what you are telling me i would like to see his work it sounds very interesting but does he actually sell the paintings and everything does he just earn something out of it just for fun no no he sells his paintings yeah okay but he also teaches at the university ah the university in my hometown yeah 0 no actually i think he is some kind of director of studies at the university of dusseldorf okay yeah but he is here he has been active for i do not know how many years okay wow respect fellow artists we like that yeah you yes so but also my another end is coming soon bye probably for the same reason okay you well that is a bit sad too i am sorry about your grandpa though 0 it is okay he has been taken care of let us get to here yeah my mom is taking care of him  and what about your grandparents 0 well well yeah i still have only my 2 grandmothers actually but and they see like my grandma she is very funny because every year she will say this is the last year i am alive this time around that is going to get me you know it is i am going and we are like no grandma that is not true and she has been saying this for like 15 years so you know how old is she i think she is 89 yeah she is 89 at this point so 0 no yeah 89 in 2 months actually so and then she started saying i just want to live until i am 90 and i am pretty sure she is going to make it through 110 at least and she is still the thing is she is still cheeky you know like she has a lot of pain and back pain yeah have you been to edinburgh i actually have never been there yeah it is very beautiful i have been there for about a week no it is not a week for a few days i am it was really nice i mean the weather is not very good but i was lucky we had a sunny day you and we went on a hike on a man on a hill called arthur is seat you i think it is king arthur i believe i am not sure bye and from that point you could see well the whole city you could see you could also see the i think the sea or i think there is the sea or the river and it is very beautiful it is a very i do not know it is i mean you can see the whole landscape okay i think it is a very i do not know i remember i have this feeling of like wilderness and the city all together because there is this massive rock they call it the art of seed and it is a i mean the view from there was nice it was a very sunny day it was the only sunny day we had the rest of the time was just raining all the time but but the city itself is very beautiful the buildings are very beautiful yeah it was very very nice all right did we eat the number the word number like the time number sorry i think that how long are we supposed to speak i think like i do not remember if it is 20 minutes or 30 it is 30 minutes but i think ah we started i think 2 minutes we are probably almost 30 minutes into the recording because the ring recording i think probably 2 minutes after we can still we can talk 2 minutes more but about edinburgh actually edinburgh i think edinburgh edinburgh this is a very weird pronunciation but actually a friend of mine has been to scotland and this is the thing i actually heard very different things about scotland some people have been there and they told me just like you said the nature is amazing and told me amazing things but this friend of mine who actually felt extremely negatively about scotland you and she complained that they always closed like the restaurants they would just close but everything at 8 pm really and yeah i do not know this is what she told me so i do not know well i do not know i am going to make maybe the product depends on did he say edinburgh or it was another town generally scotland because she has been traveling around scotland that one holiday that many years ago okay that is when she was like probably like 13 or 12 so she is my age so we talking about like yeah i do not know how old i am yeah well 15 years ago so that is but like this is i remember there was like this one very strong negative opinion about scotland like and everyone everything closed so early and she she and she could not eat yeah it is not the family friendly place i do not know i do not know i do not remember the closes so early because i remember i met i met a friend at the bar i guess was a bar yeah it was late at night and she is a press pastry chef i do not know if she is still living in edinburgh but she was a pastry chef we are working on it they went to this club and then we get in very late after they finish work so probably after 12 i assume that they were there and there was still a lot of people and yeah but this is a bar it is not a restaurant the thing is the problem is the restaurants like not bars or parks like of course bars and pubs are okay but not the restaurants this is what i was told by my friend atli so i do not this is not my 1st hand opinion so i do not know okay okay i think we can we can stop the recording now okay okay okay all right so let me stop this okay yes (EDACC-C54-00)

snake and a big toy frog for the kids she can scoop these things perfect okay bye that was perfect okay and we will see you next time i have a question for you if you could go on holidays anywhere where would you go and why now at the moment i think i would choose the greek island maybe just because i heard some nice comments and tips from my friends who have been there before about the weather and people and also about the food so i would pick greek or maybe italy from the south side necessary yeah necessary for the time i think i need to chill a little bit i am already 3 years here and no holidays in those times so yeah i need to chill have drinks and maybe some bath at the beach you know yeah this is necessary yeah but tell me which one will you pick i know that you just you are on a trip now but  thank you i do not know i am happy where i am now asia has been nice i am discovering a new culture new type of food the food here is amazing like thai food and chinese it is unreal really is that like people say really spicy food there yeah actually it is like i bought a sauce okay and it says like extra mild and it is so so spicy like everything i do not know what they what is for them is like spicy you know like or mild i do not i do not know like everything is everything has something spicy so it is interesting yeah but they use a lot of spicy here because it is very thank you thank you 5 times in a day they are praying they are like having brain work to pray yeah yeah actually they have praying rooms in many places so people go to pray there it is crazy that is why it is like yeah it is just extremely difficult extremely different of i ever seen in my life before yeah so yeah but i am really happy because the landscapes are amazing beautiful forest so it rains a lot as well i like it i really like it yeah what type of do you tell me 0 sorry i was about to ask you something else tell me i was going to ask if i know that you have been abroad for a long time now right thank you and all the countries you have been before which one is your favorite do you have one favorite and why yes i have one ireland is my favorite ireland the most beautiful country in the world i have a special connection with the land you yeah i dreamt a lot about isla before going there i lived there 3 years and i still feel the same connection than the 1st time i think i probably lived before in past life there or i i do not know i was meant to be there but i feel the connection with the land and also i think the landscapes are unique you know there is so rocky yeah they are so many cliffs you know you know because you live there so yeah and the weather is amazing as well like i do not like hot weather what about you do you like hot weather i like the hot weather i got to use it with the weather here it is totally different like from my home country right yeah but i do not know it is like i am really enjoying now the sunny days we are having here but i know it is for a short time you know as in 3 months but it is ok it is nice one thing that kind of annoy me is that we have such a long day like the sunset is 10 and 10 p m so for me it is like i got yeah because for me it is still day it is still like 5 pm because i still have sun in the sky yeah i know it is a champion it is so weird is not it but at least you have a lot maybe the day seems longer you know that is good yeah the day is longer but yeah it is a bit confusing for me but it is fine i am getting it i understand and what about food what is your favorite food now that i am far away from my country and i can say that my favorite food would be every food my mom cooks aww that is so cute in a way thinking that my family comes from the countryside right  so especially a lot of vegetables grains like beans and rice all that kind of stuff with a lot of seasoning but not spice please i can not handle spice because i got to i started sweating a lot when i am eating spice and i like to enjoy 0 my god i do not like to be like 0 my god i am going to burn here all sweaty this wet on your body yeah i dislike yeah that is the thing the thing i am missing here in ireland is this about the food and the vegetables that we have a lot in other countries and here it is kind of limited you know you it is always peppers peppers potatoes and peppers and that is it 0 my god yeah but it is nice i can get used to this and when i am missing too much some recipe i can try to reproduce them here yeah it is not a big deal it is i think i can find ways to you know yeah to and do you through my lines do you buy food in the supermarket mostly yeah most in the supermarkets now i am getting the restaurant because i am working in a restaurant right  but i am used to cook my own food not spend money like getting takeaways 1st because i am a student 2nd because it is kind of always the same thing and i like to get a lot of options you know yeah i understand favorite type of food i not really no i like different kind of i do not know i do not have a favorite to be honest i enjoy the food that i feel in the moment for example here in where i am now in asia i enjoy more fresh food for instance because it is very hot so you need something fresh like salad or vegetables fruits that is amazing because here there is so many foods yeah it is a huge challenge and we are going to try to do our best it is difficult bye but it is possible anyway bye for example i am working in a restaurant now and we have not a full menu and not even like 50% of the menu but i can say like around 30% of the options are gluten free due to this celiac disease people face here thank you and we are working i think brands they are working to improve these kind of options for customers because now we have an increased number of vegetarians and vegans and also about increased number of celiac disease as well so people are being more responsible about what they are eating or choosing to eat yeah so that is nice i think brands are working to get there and offer more options to customers because brand is like more to give an experience and they just sell the product right yeah so this restaurant i am working now i think they are on the right way for example we have a vegan and vegetarian menu main menu that is let us say the common and normal menu with all this stuff for people who does not have end disease does not have problems with dairy products or celiac products you know but also we have the options for everybody because yeah for example here in ireland it is really common in other restaurants people order the main course and some chips the french fries as a side yeah but at the restaurant i am working the italian restaurant we do not have chips and people get shocked when we say we do not have chips here 0 really that is so beautiful you yeah exactly but we have like options that you can substitute you can choose instead chips we can get some crunch nice things that suits vegetarians vegans celiacs and dairy restrictions diets so it is really nice do you get some vegetarian dishes or you always get the one with meat have you tried the ones that are vegetarian i always try everything because i like variety i like meat as well i can not lie i do like meat but i do like new options of food for example when you ask me about the food i was missing my favorite food for example in my home country it would be at least 5 times you are not picky at all no i am not picky not really here in where i am now people consume a lot of fish because it is basically all ocean around and so i try fish after like fucking 2 years something 2 years okay and and action what any reaction in your body or i do not like that it feels like the same or you thought of too weird i did not it was delicious and yeah i did not find any difference and it was also with a very well condimented with oil and lemon and stuff it was it was nice but i i will not consume that much because my body already it is like used to eating fish and i also am consuming this omega 3 tablets you know okay so yeah so i will not consume the nut so i do not need it at least like if i always listen to my body and if i do not need something i do not consume it you know i have been craving loads of vitamins for example like vitamins like c or d so i am getting a lot of fruits and i feel like my body is already reacting to this because it is something that i needed because i stopped eating meat when sorry fruits when i was not if you might say why you start to eat fruits is because you were like having problems to find nice fruits or just because you had another type of diet no it is because i never liked that much the fruits in england i never found it so tasty i do not know if that happened to you like it is not so tasty and i do not like it i try to get fruit at least once per week here chop them at least once per week but for example the strawberry i can say that now is the 1st time i am getting sweet strawberries here in ireland bye like and i am buying instrumentaries every week for at least 8 months so yeah 0 my god that is delicious that is the 1st time i am getting sweet strawberry it is really nice cause i think now is the best season for them here yes to the weather all the stuff we have here and the problems with the land yeah but it is difficult to grow fruits here and have a nice taste bananas for example for me they do not taste the same thing mango i tried to get a mango in the past and no no it is totally different no thank you i do not mind we keep trying you know yeah you know that and there is the blueberries all over the place now you 0 that is amazing they are nice yeah i can not say that is real and have you traveled that much around ireland in the last couple of months no not really i was talking yesterday with my friend that i am living here for 3 years and i am always having the problem that i do not have the visa that makes me able to travel around or i do not have the time to go or i do not have the money you know so i am not getting too hard on myself as well due to this i am just trying to finish all my stuff like college for example thank you and then when finished i can plan and travel and discover the island and also other countries visit more europe you know because i think you will be the best way for me because i can not get too distracted with i got another kind of stuff like trips on my way on my routine when i am in college or working for example and when you have the time to travel where are you going to go in europe i think the most basic destination you would be london at 1st because i have not been there and then i am thinking about go again to malta to visit my friend who is living there and i have another friend arriving there and also italy i want to be in italy does not matter if it is summer or autumn but i want to visit i think it is a nice country to visit nice landscapes have you thank you see you next from you where have you been there before in italy no just my friends that they shared pictures with me but i know the places that are amazing but i have not had the opportunity to be there okay so next ever been anthony yes i have been in a few cities in italy and it is beautiful but i went in summer and it was scalding scalding like it was awful it was like 40 degrees i do not know and i could not stand it so it was kind of difficult the trip i am not really i cannot really stand the hot weather as you can see so i stay mainly in it is now the season in venice that we need to wear that wellington boots because we have like flood in the streets the street that left because most of the streets are canals right yes you go by you but i can yeah but that is the most amazing thing that is everything canals and you see the what is the name of this boat start to travel through the canals i got done yeah yeah and you see the gauntlet passing through and it is very unique it is probably the only city in the world that is like this yeah like that you know that is nice yeah yeah and what about all the cities in europe what are the cities that call your attention france it is another country that got my attention before i came here to europe i was looking for that city called nice i think it is in the south of france 0 knees yeah like all the flowers and the colors from the mountains and roaches we have there it is like amazing so for me they say they are used to say that it is a romantic destination but for me it is like just a nice place to be you know i really enjoy taking pictures from the nature and architecture yeah be nice yeah yeah do you have enough yes i went there as well but i stayed there for 2 days and it is mediterranean style

bring these things with her from the store 6 spoons of fresh snow peas 5 thick slabs of blue cheese and maybe a snack for her brother bob we also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids she can scoop these things into 3 red bags and we will go meet her wednesday at the train station okay so we can start our conversation if you want yes i am ready do you want to tell me something for example how was your day well my day was great today i was doing some homework and then i started you know searching for articles online about you know the weather and also you know how the markets are going okay simple daily things with yes especially for the weather because here in italy it is boiling hot and yes it is i have been all day with my fan just beside me because i was literally melting yes i totally get what you are saying i am always constantly drinking cold water because otherwise i will literally melt just like you said i just finished i need to fill my bottle with ice yes well let us say that especially here on the countryside there is not even a lot of wind so you know there is not even the cold the cold that can be on the countryside we do not experience it here so no i do not know but instead since i live near the seaside let us say sometimes i can go there to breathe some fresh water from the sea but do not think that here in the city there is more wind than in the countryside because sometimes the heat of you know also the hotness here in the countryside is even worse because there is no actual times of the day where it is not hot so the weather is constantly i get it reminding me that i can not go to the sea i am done i have not even sunbathed this year me neither i went to very pale well have you tried i do not know putting aloe vera on top of the scar i am allergic you know yeah you i am sorry i always forget that you are allergic to aloe vera yeah which is a downside because aloe vera is good for everything i know actually i do not know when it was like this week let us say i was looking at some methods to make my hair let us say healthier and less dry than they are in this moment and aloe vera was one of the 1st ingredients and elements that could help my hair you should always check the labels especially if you are allergic to something just but it was you know the little thing that they give you in hotels in the yeah okay you know i was not expecting them to be composed by albebera i thought they were accessible for everyone because a lot of people are allergic to it i think i am you are the only person i know that actually is allergic to aloe vera so i would not say that a lot of people are but i feel like you would say a lot of people are because you because it is me yeah but yes i understand i can tell you that actually aloe vera is very healthy for hair but if you can not use it there is also flaxseed gel which is very good for skin and i saw it yes but it is a bit more complicated to make diy okay like i have a lot of flaxseed because there was this period where i wanted to put it everywhere but i saw that it was a bit complicated to make right and even what well i think the problem with gel diys is the fact that you can not actually store it so you have to make very little amounts and then you have to you know store it in a fridge for 3 or 4 days otherwise they go bad and i hate it because i am not very constant with diy methods and all of that  like i would prefer to freeze it but i think that also freezing products is not will not preserve their their elements their nourishment that you yeah find it there which is a bummer by the way because aloe vera is great for me i have experienced that aloe vera is very good for my hair and skin and the other day i was washing my face after i have done a facial mask with aloe vera and the next day was just beautiful yeah i saw it i was like 0 that is that is that my skin 0 really yeah i saw also a girl i followed just this girl that uses her gua sha with a bit of aloe vera on her face and her face is glowing and i am jealous because i cannot use it and you know i also have other products she used with the face massagers but i feel like we are just accepting it because i feel sorry for you honestly because for your hair which is very dry and and sometimes it gets a bit brittle oiling your hair with rosemary oil which you do and it is not like for me it is not the right option like for me specifically like every 3 days but i do oil my hair i find out that actually rosemary oil is very good for hair thanks to you it is good for everything also because if you use olive oil produced here in italy extra virgin olive oil it nourishes your hair deeply yes so for you it might be a great option to you know increase the times of the week you actually oil your hair like i would do it if i were you especially in this period because your hair might get very very dry imagine how my skin because i suffer a skin condition in my my back of my head bye also in the upper part of my head my skin gets dry and it is a medical condition you so what i did is i went to seaside and it was a sandy beach of course what happened is that little parts of sand got into my hair because you know i started running with my dog we were playing so sand was everywhere and it started to make my head itch okay again i think we should because well i think the summer makes everything worse so you know if you go to the doctor i think even if he tells you things that you already know at least you are sure that you are ok thank you and that you have to use certain products instead of the ones that you are using now because they are not working in the way that they should but do not worry i think it is just a matter of the weather being too hot because when you started using rosemary oil your hair dramatically improved in the shine and they were much more manageable they also got a little darker which i like on you and now they are even blonder on the contrary because of sun and i am always at home so i do not understand how the sun is bleaching my hair at least it is sun and not real bleach because otherwise your hair would be no that it would just fall off entirely no no no absolutely not i think i could i could not bleach my eye i think that damages are yeah too many they cannot you know i think that the damages goes directly on the roots you can shave it after well you know what they say in every video they say that if you do not have a healthy scalp your hair will never grow in the way they should you so and i do not think it just starts from the scalp i think it is also a matter of diet and stress levels 0 if you are stressed your hair is less likely to grow and to be healthy so one thing is the stress but also i think external conditions are also very very bad you and that may you know hurt your hair and damage it yeah i remember that when during university my hair were like a nest of birds and they were dry and damaged and also because i used to eat like junk food to feel happier or just to do not feel depressed depressed and well you were not that fat before so i do not think why no no no i am not fat i was not fat but you know i am choppy and my legs i have a little bit of fat in my stomach there is a i just have a stomach i am not flat at all so well i think the the the thing is that having a flat stomach is i think is something genetic or like genetics yeah little part to it but it is also the diet that makes a lot of the difference in the way you see your stomach you know my body type is like a triangle like i have i do not think i think it is rectangle rectangle but you know my waist is not that little i do not know i like my body type either way but okay i have wider hips than shoulders inverted triangle inverted triangle no 0 yeah okay but it is something very slight so it is not that big of a difference and like if you see me from the front i am not really an inverted triangle because my hips are not that wide no no no of course the more white the more normal people will that works well i mean then other people okay so yeah but i have also noticed that in summer everyone gets skinnier you like i do not know if it is because we drink more so our body get more cleansed and it just expels bad things and i do not know we get skinnier because we sweat way more than we do in the winter and also i think it is also because i started working and i do walk a lot since i work you know in that pub and you know i walk a lot tonight and i barely eat there basically because every time we start to eat me and my co workers we also everyone has something to do so we also we all eat like separately and also we do not eat at 8 or at 9 we just eat something whenever we can you so i eat way less than i did before and also very sporadically like you you work that at night and i write i work from 5 pm to 5 am basically depending on when we close the pub bye yes but honestly there are like those dead hours where no one comes or it is just a few tables so so you know one of my other co workers can just relax for a bit and then we just each give get our moment to relax and when it is too dead we just basically close the pub because there is nothing else to do okay i see your point when i used to work at the restaurant there were some hours or even nights when nobody showed up and i was completely free to be on my own and to prepare things for the next day for example but we could not close because the restaurant was inside of a hotel well i understand so well our pub is not like inside of an hotel so we can kind of decide when to stop and when to close the shop but it is also you know with it being a pub there is also the thing that most of the patrons come in at you know ungodly hours and you have to you cannot close the shop because that is the of course since the pub is relatively new it is not like they can close whenever they want so we have to get there and wait for people to go away is it the city center that is a city center i mean yeah it is very close to the city center so and a lot of people go there am i right not a lot but you know what sometimes a lot of people come in and then they get out like after 5 or 10 minutes because they just drink do a lot of shopping shots yes yes just drink and go or some of them just stay for hours and hours on end and they just order one or 2 things and just stay there on the table occupying the table basically for hours and they are just rude and there are times where like they come they stay for a few for i do not know half an hour and they just go away and they just spend a lot of money and they give you tips like you teats yes we do i do not know maybe the patrons that come often very often or like almost every day they do leave tips because they know or even friends of the owners okay they come in and they just i do not know they get a bottle of water it costs i do not know one or €2 and the rest of the day they give the owner €5 and the rest of the tip it just goes on the tips the change i you share it every day or at the end of the week for example the end of the now we buy a little container that is i think in metal we just put the tips there and when it gets completely full we just cut it because you cannot open it hey of the wives and then i think we will share it between the pick a piggy bank yes like a piggy bank exactly like that okay that is cute when i worked at the hotel thank you i was not paid because it was a tash  and i was in france and the funny thing is that we were supposed to share tips but since i was not paid a coworker of mine told me you know you know do tell me tell me where the piggy bank is and so i told her and she decided that i could take the money for me  you since i was not paid that makes sense because i mean you are still offering a service you are providing a service for other clients you are not paid so at least the least they could do is you know now you know because thanks let us let us put some context in it because my patron was really attached to money and even if the stash was meant to be paid you know sometimes they give you something they give you also €10 to go on get a beer or a glass of wine or to eat something with your friends since i was with my friends there we were working all together and some of them were they were getting thank you they could get them to go anywhere just as a reward of what they had done but this man even if it was like a 5 star hotel and a lot of rich people went there also famous italian people i saw there really rich people he was so attached to money that it could not care less of me not having money you know well that is horrible honestly how because as i said that is horrible because you are so you are just working for them you are making them make money and they do not even pay you and they will not even let you have the tip that it is all earned sorry it is all earned it is all your work there yeah and at least like let me get my money and they do not which is horrible not there it works differently like even when i went to other to other restaurants to eat the other day i was substituting a friend of mine in her work and she works at a restaurant and they pay me like €35 a night  and there were these brazilian costumers and they paid a lot and i think in brazil and in america in general tips are paid like they are mandatory yeah yes so they gave us like €20 and the owner was like you can get €10 it is all your work so it was like 20 is for the other coworker and 10 is for the other coworker and the other half is yours so i was like okay i just made €45 today and i was super happy of course because it is like a reward and it feels great also you and yes they are mandatory at least in usa sorry because my uncle told me that they are in the bill you so when you are paying you are paying also tips which is strange to us because we do not pay tips yes that is right which is very stupid to not tip the waiter because yes i mean you are paying for the ingredients and for everything else but you are not paying for their actual job like you are paying part of it but you should also pay for their service unless a lot of times also but you remember when we went to the restaurant and actually i wanted to tip i think we tip them right we tape them we will be right there yeah yeah we did with a and i loved the atmosphere in that restaurant it was very good they were not also very very good people yeah so we are so nice i want to go there as well right now yes 0 that is far away you they can airplane to go there so i do not think it is possible at the moment yes at the moment it is not possible but yes i think i will visit the city later on bye maybe not this year but to because for example if we are going to live in northern italy  it is way more simple to reach every big city there instead living in the south of course there are trains working a lot and schedules of trains are you know weird here here yes but there there are if there i mean if you have to for example go to rome from you milan you take 43 hours it is fair but in the southern regions in 3 or 4 hours you cannot reach anything  yes i mean you can reach a small city but like i mean way it is way quicker yeah if you take your car and you go by car yeah it is also horrible the streets are horrible here but yes i think yeah i mean i want to go in the northern sicily i wanted to i actually wanted to go outside of italy but i do not know where and yeah and i was searching today and i was like it is horrible to live here because if i want to go anywhere else like the costs are high like very high i you can not take anything you can not take the train because it will be a very long journey and i have no time to i do not know spend 2 days on a train just to go there and not counting you know going back to the place i leave so it is horrible actually so i just really want to go away from here that you are thinking about north in italy or well the plan other the original plan was to go to other countries like i do not know france or belgium but after today i think france is like completely cut off did you talk with our colleagues colleagues yes you were the search for the universe online to them 0 online with that yeah i was not that because i was working for my thesis sorry but i really wanted to be there and i i saw it was confusing but things yeah i saw bad things you do not know half of it we were searching for all universities there and there was none that was open you have to apply for the university and all the applications ended the deadline was may the 15th that is what i saw all the other all the other and also you had to go to another platform to get to apply for a certain university and depending on the university the platform was the same university so and you had to make a new account every time for every different university and it was horrible because i was the one doing all of this and the others were just looking with me sharing the screen and i was going insane because they asked for your degree if you had any other degree if you had your graduation and all that it was horrible  what have you thought of calling them like calling them reaching them writing an email for example i can see the deadline why there is not indication about what i have to give you what do you want just write to them i think they are way more efficient than here i think they will answer our questions yes i will certainly i think me and our colleagues will meet tomorrow i guess i do not know online again taking a wild guess yes online again and we will see what what to do what to what to see more but i am i think all of us are really you know under the weather after seeing that all of the things that we wanted to do are and not open i feel like i have lost a race even before participating i have not even participated in a race and i have still lost  in the entire world everything related to what we would like to do is horrible i think there are no opportunities and if there are they have very strict schedules and very strict requirements that you must have  and they are just impossible and only few people can just have the opportunity to to enroll and to study that well i do not know actually i do not know how much time before your academic year ends you have to think about all of that i just have no time to think about all of those things before it ends actually so when it ends we have so much work to do still yes when it ends we just have to go with the flow and wait for anything to be clear i do not know how i think everything will clear up i hope so we hope (EDACC-C53-00)

brother bob we also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids she can scoop these things into 3 red bags hey my participant number is fc 65 p 2 please call stella ask her to bring these things with her from the store 6 spoons of fresh snow peas 5 thick slabs of blue cheese and maybe a snack for her brother bob we also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids she can scoop these things into 3 red bags and we will go meet her wednesday at the train station okay so let us start the conversation okay so do you remember when you were a kid what kinds of games or video games did you use to play i used to play a lot of shooting games you i also play a bunch of simulations so basically we create a character and you can also build like a house for yourself thank you and basically what was it microp more like the sims 0 the same game you know i want to play later one too yeah okay yeah i also like 1st person shooter yeah but i think i prefer role playing games rather than shooting games yeah and i used to play a bit of a simulation game simulator game but yeah i think i prefer role playing okay so the sims they have like so they they i think they create like 4 games but my my favorite one is probably the the 3rd the the the 3rd sims game because the because i really enjoy building houses in the sims 3 because they are 0 yeah yeah their system is very good okay yeah i remember that you used to really like to design new houses in the city and sometimes you show me one of your designs yeah they were really good okay so what about books or films or tv shows honestly i did not i did not read a lot of books and i was little but there is this this is one book so there is this one comic called cedric is about yeah it is about a little boy he lives in french okay he is french he lives with his parents and his grandpa and he does a lot of silly things that were very funny to me as a kid 0 yeah i also remember that book but it is in french and my french was not really good at the time so i did not read a lot of books but yeah i read some english versions somewhere and yeah i remember that story and i think there are some similar books like that like nicolas yeah so french right yeah but i prefer marvel comics i read a lot of marvel comics probably several 1000 issues of wow and yeah which series is your favorite i think my 1st ever one of my 1st ever and most like most memorable series was the new avengers but actually marvel comics they have like a really long history and some issues they refer to the event that was verified in the past and to understand the whole story and also references in the comics you need to like yeah so which like which character was was your like it is your favorite of all like 3000 characters okay yeah back then there used to be a game called marvel heroes 2016 or something and you can actually play the character and while most of the characters that i have in the game i think they are my favorite so whenever i get a new character i read all of their comics so my 1st character was black panther okay and he has like a really cool superpower he has like a really advanced suit made from vibranium and he has like he was like a chain martial artist and he is very rich also apart from that there were iron man and well probably thor actually i do not like thor that much yeah yeah he overcomes so much hardship and he is still a hero even though he is so poor yeah he is very poor yeah but i think lately the quality of comic books is going down yeah you know it is not as good as before i think the period from 2000 to about 2011 or 2012 the best period of comic books okay yeah ok so apart from that do you watch movies yeah i actually i do not watch a lot but i like but when i do i mostly watch like tv like movies and series from from marvel as well the marvel cinematic universe i think they have a couple of new series released recently i think it is called miss marvel okay but did you watch them all or you already heard about them no i have not started watching ms morvo yet but they also had a different series called moon knight released yeah it was released recently i think it is very good the way they explore this character because usually when there is a of the i think it is very interesting because i think sometimes the origin story of heroes are quite boring out because as i said before because marvel has already has such a long history of characters and maybe subtitling was invented like 70 or 60 years ago so if they get to the origin story again it would be very boring and i think they want to craft like a dynamic interaction between the characters that is why they jump straight into thank you you can explain the start of the hero later like in flashback or something yeah yeah yeah so so they probably they do not want to do that you but i think that marvel show is for some reason they are not really good because they want to build up so many things at once they want to introduce you new characters and new event and they want everything to tie in together into one big universe so yeah even the whole show it is just like one small part of the bigger show so that is why they feel very disconnected yeah in order to make them connect together each one feel very disconnected from the whole thing so i am not sure if they can keep up like this because actually after a long period of reading the marvel comics i actually want to read like coming from other brand like independent author or like coming from year explore the alternate version of heroes so they are much much more interesting yeah because you know how they sometimes they just kill a character and like bring them back like to yeah yeah to be sure like later yeah so thank you yeah like the main the cannon sorry loses all meaning so yeah maybe it is not it will happen to the mcu in the future i feel like a lot of the new series and also the new issues of the comics they became like they started becoming very commercial so yeah it feels like a lot of those movies like they make it just to please the fans you but they do not really focus on the depth of the characters yeah like about the development yeah you and each movie has a new director and each story has a new writer so it is not consistent yeah most of the time they just make the movies to sell more toys yeah even the show like the animated version is not very good there were some really good shows but for some reason they just canceled so i am not sure about marvel anymore they used to be really good i think it is because they probably do not make enough money from those like from those that they cancel or is it because there is some other reason okay yeah yes ok so what about sport did you play any sport when you were a kid i really liked badminton i actually took a badminton class when i was i think 4th grade or 5th grade yeah but i do not see you play anymore i i you know i i kinda i kinda got like lazier and i also like i could not find a lot of time for for sports re recently i actually so so so at so at school there is there is this like i have to do a gym gym class gym classes and yeah just swing you have to swim and to you know like to probably you know like work out a yeah yeah and probably increase the height a bit more yeah thank you  yeah so you only see recently no other transport yeah yeah recently only swimming i do not know if rope skipping count as a sport or is it just like a lot of the workouts yeah just like carry a walk on yeah i used to play basketball too when i was in secret bye after a while i also forgot how to play i do not play that much anymore because when i get to high school my friend most of them do not play that game that sport so yeah i kind of stopped there and yeah literally i only do some workout at the gym and maybe at home yeah but if you have a chance would you play more sport or like if you found a team or something because i want to play table tennis but it is really hard to 0 okay yeah yeah to get my friends to play because after work most of them are very tired and actually i have some table tennis racket here with me but i cannot find anyone to play because of the work hours so yeah yeah i think most of my friends like they play soccer a lot so they have soccer teams and i probably would i mean i do not like soccer that much i think like personally i think it is quite boring but all right i probably would try to engage in more activities maybe go play soccer sometimes with the friends like connect with them or like have like a yeah it is a life right yeah but not like for the sport personally yeah just do it for you know to be active to be more active thank you yeah yeah so maybe scott is not that strong so if you do not play then you watch scott i do like i do follow the like the events but i do not really like spend time to for example watch a full game or something yeah me too because like if i see something on tv like some football match or some table tennis match then probably i will watch it but i do not actively like see yeah yeah i will program to watch them yeah so yeah i think they are okay but like i am practically fond of it yeah yeah that will do okay so what about your next holiday where would you go where would you where are you planning to go my next holiday i plan to go to ho chi minh city in july or august but i also really want to visit foreign countries such as for example singapore or australia or thailand well i have never been in a foreign country before thank you yeah like maybe outside vietnam yeah so probably you should go i have been to singapore and australia and china and laos but i think yeah i think like the best destination for you now is singapore because it is a lot different from vietnam and i also think absolutely do you plan to work in australia later or just visit i actually i do not know at the moment but i mean if the i mean if if the opportunity comes then yeah like why not yeah you should go and have a job because like austria is one of the best places to live 0 i think it is so yeah sorry yeah so when you were in australia what was the most different aspects to life compared to when you were in vietnam what changed so some people in australia they have a very relaxed lifestyle they just go to work like 7 or 7.5 hour a day and other weekend they just go have a trip either go to the park or take a hike or like some people even if they do not have a lot of money 0 yeah yeah when you go fishing you can just like eat the fish directly and just cook it again wow yeah so so nice the light is very dressing and what else and also if you live in some city like adelaide or perth they are not very crowded not like not yeah crowded like in our city now so yeah because i am an introverted person so i do not really like to have too many people around me and yeah i think that is what like the perfect environment for me i am not sure about you but like yeah what else the quality of yeah the weapon the welfare is very good well the welfare yeah you provide everything like when you go to hospital is like practically free and they build a lot of park for kids and for people in each neighborhood there must be one park so everyone can have easy access to the park and in some of the big ones yeah so wow so you can just bring your food there and you can have a barbecue with your family like barbecue is a very big thing in australia like if the temperature is like 30 or 35 they still invite you to barbecue they do not really care about the heat so it was very strange at 1st but yeah i get used to it so if i have a chance i will also go back to australia yeah i think it is also very like like very safe there like there is a lot of security and self about the safety i am not sure because when i go to the city center there is like many people who is luring and i do not think they work and they also like ask you for money for change for like some coin so yeah and i think some women yeah i am not sure how you feel about that and before i went to australia i had a fear about like very big spider and big animals in australia but when i go there when i live in a city actually i like almost never see any like really big ones like just like i think a lot of people and also the media they tend to exaggerate the situation a lot 0 ok so yeah i think like those animals they only like they only live in like certain areas but people would just you know exaggerate it and scare foreigners 0 it is just me actually not the case okay yeah but thank you actually they had a lot of kangaroos and other types of i am not sure what is it masupial like the yep right with the banks yeah yeah so yeah they do have some like really cute ones yeah but the big one x carry one they also have that yeah so probably you should prepare for that before you go to australia otherwise australia is a really good place to live and maybe you should move there and become a permanent resident or like a citizen or something i highly recommend australia for living what about you europe do you want to go there because i have never been there too and i would like to go to europe some day but i am not sure about living in europe what about you yeah i want to visit a few countries but i do not think i am going to live there i have heard a lot of not very nice things about the life over there but i am also not sure because those opinions might just be subjective and need to do some research on that okay yeah zoom is going to close all right so let us finish the conversation and see if we hit the mark of 30 minutes if not enough then i think we will continue another section all right all right close editing (EDACC-C58-00)
hi i am participant number fc 67 p one hi i am participant number fc 67 p 2 please call stella ask her to bring these things with her from the store 6 spoons of fresh snow peas 5 thick slabs of blue cheese and maybe a snack for her brother bob we also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids she can scoop these things into 3 red bags and we will go meet her wednesday at the train station please call stella ask her to bring these things with her from the store 6 spoons of fresh snow peas 5 thick slabs of blue cheese and maybe a snack for her brother bob we also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids she can scoop these things into 3 red bags and we will go meet her wednesday at the train station so i think we were had decided to talk about some television memories from when we were kids yeah and then the major discovery of uk and american television when we were both about 10 years of age so i was just remarking kind of how bleak it was back in say the late 70s and early 80s for kids and children is programming even educational stuff there was not much of it on irish television do you think no not much and it was very rare even that you would get imports like sesame street the closest thing they had was i do not know if you remember bosco yeah thank you everything was centered around pulpits thanks for early irish television because it was obviously cheaper but yeah i think bosco was the main educational thing it was not exactly sesame street standard but i think they were really limited in their budget and their production 0 total and imagination by the looks of it as well yeah but yeah i remember bosco it was fine if you were like a preschooler or in you know babies in primary school but once you hit maybe 5 or 6 you kind of grew out of it and there was nothing really that stopped the gap until we were much later much older yeah i mean it shows there was a lot of i think a serious lack of imagination when it came kids were kind of an afterthought when it came to television and radio and entertainment back in those early days and i guess the biggest change for the 2 of us would have been when we were kind of exposed to english television and by default american television yeah and in my house i was about 10 i think when that happened so that would have been about mid 80s about 1985 a and we had to get an aerial put on a roof it was a whole day out and there was a man at the common put it up and i to run in and out of the sitting room and shout up at him when the picture was good but that 1st weekend i got up really early and watched my 1st weekend of english children is tv and it was a revelation yeah i remember when we got it 1st it was just so colorful it was not as yeah drab or dreary as irish tv with their limited budgets and cheap sets i remember saturday is swap shop with no yeah edmunds and that just that was yeah opening but it was always so depressing when you were a kid in ireland that you could not join in you could not enter competitions you sometimes you could not even find some of the stuff they use for the arts and crafts the materials i never knew what a pipe cleaner was we never saw pipe cleaners no i think that was my early exposure there was a show called number 73 i and it was just i would say like you said the biggest memory initially was color and excitement and it seemed to be like almost an adult format but it was designed for kids thank you and there was so much stuff happening and wacky stuff and funny stuff and it used to switch from cartoons to comedy to drama and then the mandatory make and do stuff but the same thing all these materials it all just seemed really exotic and england seemed like a long long way away what but i was really jealous i thought to myself i will never get to go because they used to have kids on the set in the audience and they used to win like fantastic prizes and go on holidays and stuff like that too and like you say i was always really envious looking across the water so to speak at england is and it just seemed really exciting and exotic and kind of far from where we were at totally and what was even more exciting was where we grew up we got the northern ireland feed for the uk 0 yeah which was separate as well yeah they had like thank you and itv but mainly thank you it was like a lot of their productions were from northern ireland why do not you and those kinds of things thanks but if you went to visit family up in dublin they actually received the bbc wales or the itv from london bye and that got you some serious cartoons yeah yeah that you would not see on irish tv a good caliber cut quality of cartoons you know and remarking on irish cartoons because after we got the english channels you would kind of rarely go back to irish tv if you are a kid but i do not know if you remember back in the late 70s and 80s they used to buy in these cartoons from i think it was places like czechoslovakia and poland could have even been from the former soviet republic but the strange thing about them was that there were political kind of cartoons with just no speaking and strange animation and really and and they used to put those on for kids and the contrast when you saw some of the stuff that was coming in from america as well through the english channels that was just such an eye opener it was huge in the mid 80s yeah and that was the thing you would talk to your friends about it on a monday morning you would go into school and you would talk about all the cartoons that you saw i guess then tv shows you are starting to get exposed to especially american ones do you have any immediate favorites well i remember one of the 1st times seeing the flintstones all right when we were growing up the flintstones were around for a long time but i did not understand that i did not know that there was such a thing as a rerun i did not know what that meant yeah so when i saw things on tv i assumed that they were made especially for me never mind that they were just the 1st viewing of them you and i remember my dad came into the room and i was watching the flintstones and he went 0 i used to love this when i was a kid that blew my mind i was like yeah you saw this when you were here yeah and he used to laugh his head off at the saber tooth tiger kicking fred flintstone out the window at the very end yeah that used to crack me up but just to get anything from the states was huge especially when rtl was born take care their budget and they managed to import things yeah but i i think that had to there were so many people opting for because the original old old sky television was just on the horizon you you could also avail of kind of like you said english channels and welsh channels in northern ireland so irish broadcasting kind of had to up its game a little but it still did not do too much for kids or children is programming but i think one of my all time favorites and one that crosses generations is obviously sesame street because yeah that was just huge when you were a kid that had everything that had fun learning puppets comedy humor drama brilliant animation and yeah that was a huge influence when i was a kid you you know well especially when you saw it and you saw where they lived in sesame street and the thing you wanted the most as a kid was to live there bye to knock on big bird is door and you know yeah to say yeah i see mister snuffaloopagus too you are not the only one will one these little things they used to really thank you involve your imagination when you were a kid it was amazing and the catchy songs and even not just the puppets and muppets that really but the humans were endearing like mister hooper and yeah beautiful red shiny apples he used to sell in his store yeah just wanted to go in there and buy something it was just it was like a fantasy but it was somewhere that was achievable it was attainable in our minds you know yeah and also it is just there was so much humor in it too thank you and it kind of related to another one of my favorites that would have crossed over from the parents generation too which was the muppet show yeah and it was kind of i used to kind of confuse the 2 so did i good show yeah rumpachilla is an evening version of sesame street it was the grown up sunday evening yeah the main difficulty was you grew up an only child whereas i had siblings i had 2 brothers and book rogers in the 25th century was scheduled on at the same time as the muppet show so there was blue murder every sunday evening over who got to watch which yeah i was blessed because there would be large parts of the day that i would have the television just to myself so i did not have to compete so what was that that must have been tough when you have got 2 siblings and you are both slightly different ages the obviously there is no recording facilities then thanks for watching that was the thing i think kids probably do not appreciate these days that you had to be there you had to see it once on and if you missed it you missed it and that was the thing with tv back then that you would not know when something might be shown again  it is not like you could look it up it might be shown once and it could be 3 years later before it is shown again well i remember growing up in the uk you would often see on the british channels you know mention of the radio times we got you we did have some kind of an equivalent called the rte guide thanks but nobody nobody bought us only at christmas to get the bumper maybe 3 weeks spray of what was on yeah so you get it for the whole month but nobody used to buy it so nobody would even i do not know if they even showed the tv schedule in the papers back then it was very rare i was actually thinking of that there was so because there would have been approximately maybe at most 10 or 11 channels so at one point in time the paper near the back page used to have a whole page just devoted in 6 or 7 columns and you could read down what was on so that was a daily thing and the paper always seemed cheaper than the actual tv guide itself in you know so you are reading the paper for other things as well so be shared around the family yeah there were so many channels then it was simply not cost effective to print it you know what they mean and regarding like american stuff especially like like drama shows where you got out of the kind of cartoon age and then you would have all these shows like say macgyver and the a team and sci fi stuff wonder woman wonder woman earl would have been a big one for you thanks so what was wonder woman wonder woman was the ultimate female superhero and she was a princess diana prince during the day and she was some mysterious amazonian princess who came to earth to the i think she was i am not sure thank you she was from another planet but she arrived to help earthlings and i believe it was during world war ii which was another passion of mine so that kind of helped me hope for a smile it was strange growing up with 2 older brothers and playing toy soldiers but you did that is what you did yeah it kind of rubbed off on me in what i used to do well watch but my brothers had no objection watching wonder woman either trust me there was never any rouse yeah watching wonder woman they were watching it for different reasons but she was an idol she was strong and you know fort right and and she solved problems and she spun around and turned into wonder woman and she had a bike and an invisible plane that was amazing it is not like now i guess with all the marvel stuff and you know i guess back then she must have been a big figure because casting my mind back because i used to like a lot of the comic book kind of stuff for now i would watched batman and spider man and the incredible hulk so i guess wonder woman was one of the few kind of female kind of empowered role model type characters so that must have been important to being a girl especially in a boy is house kind of watching we had very few women that we could look up to mainly so bye opera stars that is a whole other yeah conversation but but really like you know in batman you had batgirl but that was towards the end and it was more of a gimmick you it was very very rare that there was a woman on tv that had that kind of status and made that kind of impression on kids and and she was dead so much so i had a wonder woman swimsuit and i thought oops i thought i was wonder woman i was convinced of it that was the power that that show had yeah over me at that such an influential age yeah i guess when i look back and think on tv from when i was 10 11 12 it was very boy and kind of male centered you a lot of action shows stuff like airwolf and i am luthe thunder and it was always like a man on a machine and but did you like those kind of programs too where you kind of have a tomboy attitude to watching some of those or it was a case of because you had such limited choice if it was thank you it was watchable and it was not you know a politics discussion show after the news or something you would watch it so you would watch it the the a team or you would watch airwolf but what i really enjoyed the most were the big kind of mini series family events you the big things like when v started yeah they showed a mini series or even something as silly as north and south or cain and abel those big black busting mini series the whole family would sit down as a family and there would not be a peep we might not understand it at the same time yeah my parents got a different outlook on it but we would all sit it was an event you know you especially if it was on over 2 separate nights yes nobody got you sit in each night and watch that was a big big event yeah i guess it was a unifying force you in ways too and it was rare that obviously like i said i was an only child so i did not i kind of mom and dad watched the tv at night i would watch during the day so i would say it was rare to find something that could unify all age groups and i will see you next time and all the kind of dynamics of a family so and just i guess i was just going to say speaking to that one there was one in particular one tv show every week that we always sat down and we never missed but it used to terrify me and it was the incredible hulk yeah and the part when he would transform into the incredible hulk and you you see his shirt bursting on his sleeve on his arms yeah he is turning green and his eyes change that was i was gone i was behind the couch every week without fail yeah i was gone behind the couch and i would not come out until he i could handle it while he was the hulk and i could handle it before he was the hulk i think it was the transformation and just when he looked up you and his eyes had changed i am sorry 0 my gosh thank you gone yeah god i used to like the program a lot but i think everyone suffered from that moment because it changes gear quite quickly for kids program but i think everyone has that memory of the look down and then the look up and the change and the eyes and he just ran for cover you know so yeah that was a big show if you are watching the tv go on do not make him angry you you all like him when he is angry i guess i kind of respected that that they made like i say tv shows for kids in a really adult format bye so they did not hold back much and i do not think there is that kind of crossover these days where you would have something that is like a drama but it is aimed towards a kind of a younger audience that much you know not so much i think you know the kind of nickelodeon style took over with saved by the bell and all that you we grew up with more dramatic backgrounds especially with the british programming things like black busey are yeah you know there was some beautiful period dramas that we would watch you we would actually sit down and watch as children was not there ones like the secret garden there was just some beautiful ones another adaptations of the enid lighton thank you which i do not think you see nowadays no but that is one thing i would say rte did quite well the used to buy a lot of adaptions of children is classics like i remember treasure island and stuff like that too they were really really good and the old mark twain stuff like huckleberry finn and tom sawyer lord loved you yeah barry faden and tom sawyer yeah yeah yeah so that is one thing i credit them for they were quite strong on kind of drama you but it was usually kind of it was very seasonal it was usually during the summer when we had summer holidays and stuff like that too my abiding memories of the summer would be tom sawyer but it was it must have been a european production because it was done you so yeah that was really common and i did not understand what was going on because there was no subtitles granted we did not have to read it yeah i used to scramble my brain i did not understand that there was dubbing in other countries so after a while you get over it but you would be wondering why their lips are not actually in sync with what they are saying thank you you never realizing that they were german or austrian or something but the same with heidi do you remember heidi yeah i do and i remember the dubbing was you absolutely atrocious and and it was really something you had to come to terms with over time you they did not know this after a long period of time but yeah it was really really obvious and but i guess it was budgeting to they kind of could not buy the cream of the crop or develop bye their own stuff so they bought everything in but at least there was some kind of thought put into it and did you go through any kind of phases with cartoons when you were a kid like collecting stuff i know like stuff like care bears and stuff like that was huge and kind of it was a bit too old for care bears by the time they came around and my little pony i kind of came in at the end of the party with the my little ponies but i did get one as a birthday present off a friend but but it was not something i was really into i never really had any merchandise with respect to a cartoon i think you were to us comment you were more star wars in that were not you yeah i think that was very generic and universal but i thank you i think in ireland too when you were an irish kid merchandise and stuff that was not really a big part of your daily life you know and it is again it was very much a uk kind of thing yeah all that stuff you could kind of collect it seemed to kind of stop before it came over to ireland so it was 11 12 13 really before i got into collecting stuff but you like star wars was a huge kind of event for my childhood and it was really good merchandise i think merchandise that you can actually go out and use your imagination with yeah is a really good thing you know and that is what the stuff like star wars but yeah star wars seeing that for the 1st time was absolutely huge you know i think you personally when sky started their own saturday morning tv shows and i think they had dj kat for a while that was or was that european euro tv or something euro channel yeah you are a chad i think it came from amsterdam but i remember that well that was in and another layer of kind of very exotic stuff you had not seen because there was all these cartoons from europe and that they were buying in and i remember a lot of japanese cartoons that was the 1st time i saw transformers yeah stuff like that and that was huge for merchandise because the toys came 1st and then yeah cartoon so there was no shortage of transformers and then you had the cheaper rip off transformers that you get yeah in the not so branded shops you know yeah but that was the 1st time excuse me that was the 1st time i remembered there being a big kind of hullabaloo over merchandise you transformers and then the teenage mutant ninja turtles turtles yeah yeah out of cartoons bye that is one i never really talked to i think i was a bit older yeah when they kind of came around but i remember being absolutely astounded when my cousins came home from england with actual transformers based on the cartoon well and i think that is when the whole kind of japanese animation kind of opened up 0 this side of the world as well it is very common these days but it seems so different and so new yeah i remember one that was a huge influence on me and it was rte who had bought it but it was a really old 70s japanese cartoon called battle of the planets 0 my god that was remember that yeah you i was very young like 567 but that was that was a huge cartoon but back we used to wait all day to see it and once a week around half 4 in the evenings that was the other thing too with irish broadcasting they never adhered to specific viewing times cheers they would say they would be showing a program or a cartoon at 50 clock and it might appear at a quarter past 6 it was infuriating back then they used to just cut things off yeah that you have been waiting a week to see and into your earlier teens then did you start getting into more like american tv that must have been 0 yeah thing like big shows i remember you know the sitcoms and stuff like that ended yeah probably the biggest one in my house growing up would have been the carlsby shop yeah that was huge on a sunday thank you when that started you did not you never missed the cosby show even though my dad again he was an avid tv viewer so he always had something to say about the tv but he did not like the cosby show or bill cosby and used to insist that that was not funny and he could do a better job and yeah he probably could have yeah but it was really just viewing on a sunday evening definitely i guess before we know what we know now  it was so big because it crossed all kind of cultures and kind of globally the whole family used to sit down to watch that show i guess you start paying more attention to more kind of dramatic stuff bye i remember the things like miami vice and cheers getting into that kind of more adult kind of glamorous world too when you were a kid that was kind of exciting and english channels produced a lot of good kind of cop shows and tv shows that i used to watch when i was a kid did you ever you favorites i used to like dempsey and magpiece yeah and that was a good one and then as i got a little bit older and you know a bit more worldly wise i was able to understand more of what was going on in things like cracker i used to find that really interesting yeah really really good but that would have been above the kind of remit we were looking at when we were kids it was not made for my age group but i used to love yeah detective side of it the investigative side of it but yeah you know when it came to the cop shows and stuff like that usually you would migrate over to things like hell street blues yeah i think rte used to show that one was not it yeah they both that quite wisely but it was you it was always on really late when i was young that it was kind of beyond bedtime it was usually around quarter to 11 or so so it was later when i got up thank you but one cop show i used to love when i was a kid you used to probably watch it too was tj hooker with william shatner with the stuff that was huge was that the girl from dynasty what is her name yeah heather lockwood peter locklear that is it it was william shatner and another young kind of italian actor used to do a lot of the heavy lifting and a lot of the running and chasing yeah but yeah that was a big big show actually you have just reminded me of 2 shows that i loved growing up to american ones one was the fall guy absolutely loved the fall guy i just yeah i would have given anything to move to california there and then i was just amazed by the the place and the other was the chiefs of hazard 0 yeah i would forgotten about that that was huge yeah that was cute in ireland so much so that i would refuse to get into the car if someone opened the door as a child i would only get in and out through the window yeah like the duke boys i would only yeah climbing and out through the window and there was no way i was if you open the door for me no you had to close the door roll down the roll down the window there was no electric windows yeah then roll it down and then in i go i think that was really popular in ireland it seemed to click with 2 things which was cars and outlaw culture yeah the fact they used to make moonshine and smuggle and stuff i think yeah it was a big show on this side of the world i think the irish liked it because like that we are always trying to get one up on the authorities and bas hague and yeah you know we used to have to finish it yeah it was a rebellious thing and then there was a good but looking girl in small shorts and that always helped with the viewership i i just love the car it everybody in ireland would have killed to have had the general lee but you would never see an american car like that in ireland it was a ford fiesta or nothing yeah i did see some like ford escorts over the years that were modeled up to do look a bit like the general league and that was as close as they came but yeah i guess again in back in ireland in those days everything from abroad seemed very exotic and very unobtainable it is like you mentioned the fall guy and it that was a show about a stuntman yeah lived in hollywood and he kind of solved mysteries on the side and stuff like that too there is like a private investigator on the side yeah but yeah these are the 1st glimpses you get of places like california and that kind of lifestyle and it just seems you know like you would never see the likes i guess for some to another huge show from when we were a kid would have been magnum p i with tom selleck yeah that was a big event loved i loved the tash i loved the shorts and loved the ferrari yeah i think that was designed to have something for the mom everyone for dad and some for the kid yeah into one you and it is something we watched recently as kind of adults and it has not held up tom selleck has as an actor but my god it is really badly written and badly constructed but when we were kids we used to just be enthralled i think you were always just waiting for him to jump into that ferrari and drive and the rest to students it did not matter well that is it and they always say you should never really revisit the stuff you watched when you were a kid because it does not hold yeah the same magic you know yeah you start to see the flaws in it yeah i guess that is a good measure of it because when you do go back and look at certain things the really good stuff still holds up you know but yeah i guess a lot of that time was about distraction it was a lot of surface and not much depth we imported the glamour but we never really had the substantive glamour that we wanted thanks so we just so it on the tv community listen i really appreciate having this chat i really enjoyed it it was lovely some of the things i genuinely forgotten about you brought them back to mind like battle of the planets i think i might go and look at them youtube thanks yeah that is youtube it is all there so it is good to talk to you okay take care you too bye bye bye bye (EDACC-C61-00)

also need a plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids she can scoop these things into 3 red bags and we will go meet her wednesday at the train station what are you doing that is fine how are you doing i am really tired i had work from like 9 to 5 today and it was kind of steady at the store so there were cases where persons were like there are cases where the store is really empty then probably in the next 5 minutes you will see like 15 different families come inside just to buy candy so it did really exhaust at one point but never stopped i do it quite well that really sounds exhausting that sounds like a lot yes i am comparing to me i really have not done anything much all day other than chores and basically play games and back to bed my games i swear you are obsessed with games i very much i was playing mortal kombat and i am you play that on your phone or pc or a television both i play on both it is really cool though you should try them all no i am not really a games person and i actually prefer to like go out and enjoy my surroundings instead of being stuck and looking at a computer screen or a phone screen every single day it is not that fun how about games you play games like sports recreational actually i am not very athletic norfit i do play tennis though 0 that is right you know i have always wanted to do tennis but i have never gotten the chance to actually play tennis perhaps you can teach me one day yeah we see sure probably it is not really that hard and seeing that you are like into sports i think that you probably might be a natural well that was nice too so when you were a kid did you like used to play video games every day or were you like an active child like myself yes i was an active child growing up yeah i played video games but not so much as i do now when i was a kid i would most likely be at the river the beach you know doing things i love going to the river that is one thing that i miss about jamaica the rivers i can not wait to come back home but you really would not be enjoying the river much now i mean even though it is summer yeah it is summer but it is raining i doubt that jamaica is never cool it is it trust me it is really cool right now i am like i can not wait to go back home in september it is like the you the weather like it is either hot i do not know how to explain it but it is the weather here is just so bipolar like for instance yesterday there was a thunderstorm right right and it was raining heavily like it was thunder lightning heavy showers and then like 5 minutes like i do not want to lie then like probably like 10 minutes after no probably an hour or 2 hours probably a couple hours the sun came out like so bright like if it was jamaica it probably would have been raining for like 23 days i was like but that is kind of good yeah like you do not like it yeah yeah no no everybody seems to be talking about stranger things have you seen it have you ever watched it stranger yes i am currently watching it right now what is it about like i want to start it but it is this it is like a it is not really scary it is not a scary film tell you that it is not really it is actually fun and it is mostly it starts off with like kids like some 5 not 5 year old my bad probably like some 10 12 year olds they discover some sort of monster 0 i am like so it is like superstitious no is it like supernatural does it have like like what kind of supernatural things that it has like is that they are vampires werewolves aliens yes 0 so aliens do not slice because those things those things do not even have eyes that like do they have power and stuff like that yeah they do have is it a case where kids are fighting supernatural beings because that probably would be good yes you it is really fun but like i probably should watch that how about you do you have any tv show or cartoon you like no like i remember once i tried started watching like season one but it was not that really interesting so i like kind of stopped and then like since recently whenever i go on social media like tiktok instagram everybody is talking about season 3 for changing things i am like what did i miss like why you know like how it gets so popular so soon bye was it always chocolate i do not know it is really good it is great the last series that i watched was fear milwaukee and the dead that is like a zombie yeah like a zombie a couple lips or whatever that word is yes sounds good sounds like something i would enjoy yeah it is good but the thing with those series shows is that zombie a couple of times the writers or the directors or the producers they always kill off the main character and that really sucks because sometimes you get so attached to this character and then boom the next episode comes on and you realize whoa you have to say goodbye to that character and that really made me sometimes you bye all right but otherwise it is a good series i am currently waiting on the new part i am hooked i love it and it is a realistic show i am going to check it out for a fact you are not checking on anything i will no no i will i will for real i will alright so what is your favorite thing about university right now 0 networking i get to meet a lot of interesting people honestly 0 that is charlie even especially you know me like i love like are you having face to face classes are you like meeting these people online no online but i do meet some of them face to face for class projects and stuff i have never met none of my university students university

next school year you honestly i would not mind because i am trying to like go to school part time and then like get a job on the side so like if it is hybrid you know that would be more easier to like accommodate a job so you are like what way you are going to switch from full time to part time or no way well part time honestly i do not know i just think that i do not want to go to school in the nights yeah because at my school you can either be a day student or even student 0 we do not say nights we say evenings student evening student so like for your daytime your classes will probably finish like 4 the latest evening students your class will probably finish like 8 the latest in the night and i just think that i should not be at school at 8 in the night exactly that is my long view but if you have to do it you have to do it but personally me i would not really shit yeah i would be tired let us pass i feel like at night your brain is more relaxed so you are not yeah well probably it is it is the opposite for other persons but for me i know when it is night i want to sleep you know i am currently doing summer classes and most of my classes are in the summer really bye that is so good yeah how many phrases are you doing in a separate i am doing 2 courses in the summer and when do they finish like august no they finish in mid next month you that is that is good it is like

honestly i am not even that type of person i have never been a boy over just friends yes exactly i am so hungry really wanted to eat today i have not eaten yet really yeah totally thanks lee well this morning for breakfast i had noodles that is a soup called noodles you i do not tell me that is a lot this morning i ate toast just toast just toast like french no like i put some bread in the toaster and then i put butter on you and then i had a cup of tea 0 that is good and then for lunch i had rice and was it it was red beans red bean beans with a patty a jamaican leaf patty it is actually good it is yeah it kind of tastes like the original juicy beef patty that we have over there but like the crust you know like juicy beef crust is kind of like crispy you know it has that crispy crunchy taste to it texture to it sorry let us go but like 0 my peace by the music she is pretty expensive the cost of cheese is like what now probably like what is this for real 0 my gosh 0 my god $300 for a cheese party see 3 are my children you got to be sure probably you are no i think it is exactly i do not think i am tripping i remember we could buy patties for like a $100 each when mothers just you remember when the mothers was the mothers restaurant opened i think we were in like high school 1st probably 1st or even elementary school yeah and you could get a pass for like $100 no it is crazy $300 right crazy beyond the eyes the worst part is one patty is not even enough but you know it is great you love it so you are going to keep buying it all the time like no matter how much you it is come to that case but the prices are too high too high we need to protest actually is high but are we going to stop buying it no no i am going to stop buying it because i am not going to stop i am sorry i am going to stop because $300 0  but you trust take kfc for instance girl kfc is so high and it tastes so bad like why do they keep raising the prices for that awful chicken i do not know but i am going to keep buying that singer box thank you i do want to kill for yourself what is your favorite thing to get a gift from but lately honestly honestly lately i have been having a liking for like popeyes 0 i tried popeyes here in america it is not good it is not good it is not good and the funny thing is i have never like ate popeyes in jamaica so i do not know why i bought it over here because i do not really like fast food you are still because it is just a dream you what you do not how about how about pizza yeah i love pizza who does not but i will not pay anyone for pizza like very good do you like pineapples on pizza i do i try no you no no no no pineapples do not belong on pizza do not belong on pizza okay you try it no i would not write that you should cross your wish i thought i would not like it either because i am true come on this is i like pizza what supposed to be cheesy spicy meaty why the hell are you going to add pineapple to that that is like an herbal combination that is crazy though there was 0 i did you remember when we went to that mexican restaurant i think it was what was the name chilisa is 0 yeah the photos are it was like trash actually i am actually glad because the only thing i would actually go back there for is that chicken is that chicken taco yeah probably sorry i like the pina coladas too like they yes and the people are laughing yeah but i tried this mexican restaurant here i think you i think it is called chipotle i am not sure because it is like mexican and i can not pronounce it but it is really good bye no not chick fil a chick fil a it is not chick fil a it is chick fil a something like that i bought like a burrito bowl and i got like i saw you post about it yeah it is good it is good it is good i got like i am white rice chicken cheese sour cream lettuce a little tomato and they put everything in a bowl and then they it is so good honestly chilita was just not it in terms of mexican food but the real deal is here whatever they are doing at chilita in jamaica is not it the girls are so good that is why it is called ladies do not that is actually you it is actually time to spend that is why because in a way they do not have the right recipe i really just enjoyed the chicken that is all that beef i would not mess with that at all that seems to be my fix yeah like that was not it for real for real alright so what did you do today i guess every for anyway the other and do chores play games chill back and back 0 because i got this book get rid of so a top page essay yeah scale i know right i can not remember the last essay that i wrote school ended in like probably april for me but tomorrow like i got i got tomorrow is my day off i might 1st job but i got to go to my 2nd job i do housekeeping it is hard thank you it is like because i do not have like my my my ss yet i have to do like jobs that are willing to hire me and sadly oathkeeper is the only jobs that will entire but i get my ss tomorrow so that is good i can quit oathkeeper but i will not quit it until i get like a better job like an easier job cause honestly i think oathkeeper is maybe it is not hard but to me it is hard because like it is the 1st time i am doing it i totally understand 11 rooms and mind you i start at 9 in the mornings like everybody else and then i have another job at 4 so like i have to stop working before 4 so i can get at least half hour to go to my next job because i got to walk to my next job so i managed to clean like 9 of the rooms so i had like 2 remaining when i got my 2nd job my

going to lie big mid summer yeah this idea reminds me of i took part in a study once this is like 1st year of college and it is called we were we had this kind of like online network in ucd where like you kind of take part in research and then if you get enough credits and you can get people to take part in your research for you then time it was kind of a scam because i did all the work and then nobody took part in my study but yeah it is my fault i guess but you know when you sign up for a study and send you a bunch of information saying like your code will be this and like do not use your name when you are in the study and stuff and like it is really important to keep privacy and stuff and do not disclose information and stuff and then i remember going to one study once and then like i like knock on the door and then the person there is like 0 hey is this and then she says my name like i had like my code written in on my arm and stuff saying like you a bad start to study but  but like i actually turned out it was not an issue it was a different melody but it was pretty funny maybe the whole name thing in this thing is a bit of a formality are we breaking the fort wall by doing this i hope it is not too weird for the people on work com where we can see you you and we have an amazon is in as well but so we have some questions to go through i do not have my name i have my mom is name so apparently i am still logged in as her and so the games when you were a kid what kind of games do you used to play and is there one that you remember well football you are saying football yeah yeah what else did i used to do played a lot of kajui did you notice fifa obviously so it kind of just various different forms of football one of my mates like he lost a shit ton of money playing fifa once cause generally you can buy like all those microtransaction stuff 0 yeah something like 0 he must have spent over 500 600 close to grand i would say i am not i am like i came up to his house one day and he was like 0 i was like geez connor your team is like really good cause you know what you build like your own team on it and stuff i was like you have got really good teams you ever spend money on this and he goes nah nah nah man i look over in the corner of the room and he has got like a massive stack of all these things that used to buy and it is like basically in like a game case but they are all €20 each or something yeah i remember hearing before you know those games about the microtransactions and stuff that are free yeah make their money off like one of the player base which is kind of like depressing because like there is like one that a 100 people is kind of super addicted to buying stuff and then they spend so much money that it pays for the remaining 99 people it is just kind of like crazy when you think about it like it is like they are spending so much money that like they do not need one of a 100 people to actually pay money which is sort of like a almost exploitative but yeah kind of funny as well when i was working in woody is like this guy who was working it he was like 0 james i am not in a good mood and i was like 0 what is wrong and he was like my girlfriend is after spending like over a grand on candy crush yeah yeah my and this guy was making minimum wage and he had like 3 kids to provide and stuff like that and he was saving up for his motorbike license or something 0 my god and she was he was like yeah i only found out last night weird ones us to be into as well yeah that is a big problem that people burn through their children is inheritance by playing candy crush that is pretty bad fair play that is what i want to be like when i am old and frail can you win one of your candy crystals surely not i am not sure i think you can score extra points and stuff yeah so do you make your money back off i do not think so cause like i think that children play as well so like it is hardly gambling you there is an idea though kissing up for children 0 yeah i like that they are business idea well you could the leather plex is basically like that though that is kind of that is actually exactly what it is is not it because basically like not only that they just win shitter prizes as well yeah like it is never worth the money ever yeah it is just like 0 well done you have won a stuffed teddy and you have after paying €600 for that yeah he wanted disease stuff dirty yeah that will go on the back of your cupboard in a week is time i still remember i was going there once with our friend who works at pfizer and like we were walking i was like well it was like it was like bring your own beer building and i remember walking in like getting my id ready and then the fancy was like i will go on ahead i do not need to see your id so i was like walking along and then like your man tries to come with me and then he like blocks him with his arm and says like you can not come in whoa he is like he is like he is showing me your id but like cause like yeah you obviously talk about i looked old enough to not have to have an id but you talked like your man did not you are like 0 you have ever put his arm out and stopped him like whoa would you like to be a dancer i think i would be good at it i feel like i would be too like 1st of all too weak but also too like not do you actually challenge like if somebody is like they consider the pros and cons of beating somebody up and before i do it you have to look a little bit more badass i think you got to you got to remove one of your eyes and get like do you know the way those guys will like make their teeth sharp by like making like fangs or something and like find it yeah you look a little bit more scary then there used to be a bouncer who worked in the academy and she was like an old lady but like she was like proper like stern actually she would have been like a good school teacher it was kind of like scary old catholic ladies who were like you know like just they like they are just terrifying i do not know who to give an example of but like she was like a bouncer in the academy and like she used to be proper like certain people that like i think that is the one person you really do not want to mess with yeah it is the most dangerous person in the world is like vicious ladies but yeah no the big answers are funny like and the people i have heard of have gotten like beaten up by the answers for no reason but they always say it is for no reason but then can you trust them i wonder if that is just an irish thing or is it like everywhere yeah ties in yeah like i am my lecturer was telling me one stuff his mate was a bouncer and one day he was working there and some lad was like trying to get in and he was like 0 sorry but but you can not be doing that because i forget what your man was doing i think he was just spitting on the bouncer or something and anyway he goes back in the bouncer inside the door for a sec and as he comes back out there is the lag comes back with a 2nd shotgun damn yeah yeah is this in america or is this no it was in ireland time yeah so yeah anyway so he gets back inside dives on the ground your man starts firing shots through the door and then runs off i thought that he was trying to like use the shotgun to get into the bar and then he was going there and like then i get a drink with this is trying to go next that would have been a better option i would have done that you would have brought that gun in well no it is just you know to have the feel of that power that is true that is probably the best way to kind of feel like a mom yeah very well than anybody else no wonder other countries have gone to north oceania yeah that would be cool i remember talking to a friend of ours that you can probably guess who by you saying how he thinks that ireland should legalize guns 0 yeah i know exactly who you are talking about but you know it was funny this was years and years ago and i remember like i remember like this was like you know probably like 4 or 5 years in school and like he kind of like he had it pretty well taught out and like i remember kind of like being like well that is a terrible idea and then he was like why and i was like i am not sure but you know it was one of those funny things like you know when you like you kind of like know intuitively that you are right but like you can not really you are the person who knows the case better than you maybe you were just caught out connor and you could never you know your head just did not wrap around that you were wrong that is true i knew that your man had a better case than me but he was also kind of unconvincing the idea of just legalizing guns and arms you know what i mean with all the problems we have here yeah maybe it would solve some of them maybe it would solve new delinquency i do not know with all the people i grew up with i would not want them to have a gun yeah they are the last people i could ever want to have a gun yeah yeah that is kind of just like i guess it is not really a problem i quiet into the i think i was saying to you earlier all of my colleagues are over in america for a big conference and they are in some dodgy neighborhood in california it is like san francisco but apparently you can not wear red in california do you agree with that what if you are wearing red outside then you risk being mistaken for a member of the blood jeng people will shoot you yeah no cause like cause i get to have like these like gang shootings and stuff and i did blood gang always wear red and identify themselves and so they imagine if you are kind of just like walking around and like a red jumper and then dudes like he is a blood gun 0 my god i do not know if it is true someone told me that once so i do not know if it is true but it would be pretty funny if you were just kind of wearing if you were at some exhibition and you got shots because you were in san francisco now i do not really wear red but i think i will take it i call everybody else 0 that was rad imagine if you were going to work and you just got shocked some dude taught you were a gang that is going to be embarrassing this entire super value is run by the put yeah it is like a blue one for the crips like a blue supermarket tesco is versus superman yeah it is turf war well there is a whole thing about aldi versus little like apparently they have like a territorial dispute 0 that is his badass but yeah i had it always like an aldi next to a supervelocity to a little like if i needed to like i would really open up one in some location and the other supermarket would open up another one in the same location that is amazing yeah i do not know what the point is but like they kind of just want to be the number one do you think it would ever be like an all out war thank you like right now it seems like a standoff you know they are just kind of tech and tests in the waters but one day i might like break out cuban missile crisis kind of situation yeah yeah sort of like 0 wait maybe i should mention that it is a delicate balance to the maintain yeah i was going to mention this thanks country but i do not know if i should be allowed to do that yeah maybe there are people running this study i do not know really you know it is next class favorite book film or tv show or cartoon let us be honest like every time when you are younger was good that is true although i mean you know what when i was like really young then i would never watch things that were live action the talk that they got anything for live action was for adults and so i can never watch like jake and josh or something like that 0 yeah no i was the same i do not even watch that it had to be a kind of a cartoon or had to be kind of like yeah a cartoon or animation in some way and then i was like 6 i was kind of like hold on a 2nd had to be spongebob had to be you know your son jack fairy out there and say yeah yeah too right you know mcdonald is he was a genius yeah no way yeah yeah it was he actually and then he was like a genie who there is an episode for like timmy like gets rid of his fairy godparents and then he replaces him with a really sleazy genie he finds and like the genie was voiced by norm i would just prefer if timmy is wish was to replace his atferior parents with just nora mcdonald yeah yeah have that for an episode that would have been a better system i think we should be the writers i am not sure is it shallow i think it is probably ending now apparently they rebooted it but it is like a new girl now or something it is a gritty realistic remake is he making a horror film based on a menu called blood and honey yeah you were showing me let us go what the hell he must be in the public domain you can not really like yeah that is it either that or that they are a bit of a cut suit i have to pick it we should make like a frozen like elsa frozen horror movie no yeah i really do not want to do that well actually that must have been my unconscious mind because there actually was a horror film called frozen where it takes someone stuck on a steel lift 0 it was like from like 2009 something like that but i remember being in like extra vision years and years ago and someone was like exchanging a copy of frozen the horror film for frozen the children is film cause they were like told by their like wife to pick up a copy of frozen from the dvd store and then she got the wrong one it is this film where it is like someone is still kind of ski lift in the storm are you sure you kids want to watch this okay 0 my god that is brilliant yeah no honestly if i had a kid like i just show them all the grades does not matter what age it is thank you i would show them django unchained or i would show them godfather and who knows maybe your kid would be cooler for it you maybe you just be like exactly like vito cordiani or something it is like adopted mannerisms of the characters emma ma you just show them all the sopranos yeah that is going to be you when you are older that is my fucking boy hello 0 if you could have any accident what would it be any accent yeah because they seem thank you we are really focused on accents here yeah i think it is a good accent is a you know how people when people do not speak english fluently and then they learn a variant of english so that people will i guess if you are german you can learn english english british english or american english 0 yeah yeah i always tell but i am you know they think it is a nice accent is people who have a british a british italian accent so they are from different from italy but they learn british english that makes sense and they have kind of like if they have because it sounds kind of like they have like a posh voice but they have a bit of like a mediterranean twang to it no i have never heard of this accent what the fuck yeah it used to be like a researcher i was working with and they had like a proper like they were from italy but they had like a proper like posh british accent but like you could tell that they were like also italian it was really strange accents i do not know how to it is kind of hard to explain but like that is pretty cool i bet you what would your accent of choice be scottish maybe it has got a nice appeasing it is pretty cool though yeah i remember there was that little girl in our room she had a real thick skull of shacks and it was pretty funny hey santa yeah she is like marta are you coming out to play she will be knocking on the door and then she looked at her letterbox and go i am nudia in there we have you surrounded yeah i remember when i was in edinburgh i was like 14 with the scouts and like there is just one dude who like worked in like a news agency and i was saying to you like iron brew is great like i wish you could get it more in ireland but like i remember i wanted to get like a kind of iron brew off this guy and i asked him for it he was like i used to meet today regular right in brough i was like yeah he was proper like deep rural scottish and so like kind of similar to kind of like if you have like a real like a deep rural irish accent 0 i thought of ireland and then there is nadia god f ing look at that i always find it funny when you see people like you will see like a lecture or you see like a video on youtube of somebody speaking in like a deep irish accent and then everybody in the comments is like can someone annotate this i can not understand it you can kind of get it like you can understand what they are saying but nobody else can because of how deep their accent is my dad is uncle lived in tipperary his whole life in the same house and he fecking had the tickest accent i have ever heard and not only that he had like one of those old kind of voices that is like you know it is kind of dying and it is like this sort of but then he was also like basically deaf as well so he had no idea what he was saying he was like yeah you know that sort of thing when you do not understand somebody and you just kind of nod your head and go ah yeah i know what you mean yeah i would not have that kind of upsetting for them though because like you know because eventually they are going to figure out that they are not getting through to you yeah i do not know it is funny i imagine if there is a fire you got to go you got to run for your life as a fire and you are like yeah yeah i mean you just seem like the most chill dude ever it is the most chill bloke in the world that is like a classic sitcom scene where like someone is speaking in like a random language and then the person is pretending to understand it but then they have like subtitles that kind of gives context and it is like you know thanks for your time i could definitely see that as like a joey from friends thing or something they had a scene of that in the airplane you know the phone airplane which is like 0 yeah yeah she is like excuse me is josh still playing or is that like dead i do not know i do not know i do not know much about java i am actually not even fully sure what java is java is a new word for cool 0 is it i thought it was like a whole like might as well just be a dialect it is just like slang that people use maybe i do not know much about jokes anfield ones and you in the like the shop the gift shop and they have like a little book in there that you can buy and it is all the chance that liverpool use thank you but who in their right mind is taking out that book of going shall we write a verse 5 of this one please i think the hem sheets and masks where they are like you know today we will be doing him number 2 and everyone is like that is good let us get this season and we are not in a fight or touch when they have the book for football for old ladies and like missus doyle and their friends are all reading through it and then they are like they are all sitting around the book of the match and then they are going like go on my son that is on the rail 0 i like that so where would you go in the world if you could go anywhere in the world  you know it is weird i was looking at the ryanair website today and i was going to realize how cheap flights can be if you book them way older than that i was kind of thinking like i technically could go anywhere in the world you can do it if it is well in advance or like the next day yeah it depends yeah it is kind of like a solid tweet once or somebody was like i can just go i can i am an adult so i can just go to the store and buy a whole cake and eat it all but like every day i do not it is a weird kind of like a self restraint to it fekka let us go to back in jamaica tomorrow yeah let us do it but where would you would you beg about your country of choice is there to go to now i think i would go to rwanda nice because that place is a bit of messed up in the day and i want to know if it is okay now because you do not hear me you can go there to check you would not this google there you do not hear me anymore up there or what about you know i heard ethiopia you know they do journalism there you gentlemen yeah yeah there it is is it ethiopia yeah there was like 2 guys from i think it was either iceland or finland they are basically the same place but okay probably not but you know they but they went they got kidnapped because they were doing journalism not really yeah that is crazy they were kidnapped there for a while and like they were locked in like different rooms and they would like tap on the walls to each other and they said like as long as i could hear my mate i knew i was like going to be okay that is nice and they got any of it they are animals and we will see you tomorrow i was watching a film recently diving bell and the butterfly about your man who had locked in syndrome he was totally paralyzed and he could not do anything except for blink but apparently it is a true story the film is a true story but it is a true story in the film where he gave up his seat on an airplane to one of his colleagues who was going on the trip and then the plane was hijacked by terrorists and then they took your man hostage and so it was kind of like that and for them to kind of have a whole subtext where your man was like cheers things for that is it a true story yeah it thinks that like a command in the film like wrote an autobiography by blinking so like like his like editor would read him the alphabet and then he would like blink whenever he got thank you guys letter that is so fackin tedious 0 my god yeah but you know what it took him 3 months to write the book which is insane like yeah that is the thing i have been working in articles for like 6 months and they are not ready jesus i guess though in a way he had nothing else to do all day like he kind of had to focus on that but so you are saying if you were paralyzed you would be able to write your articles a lot faster i mean i just had nothing else to do i guess it is kind of like back when i had covid and i got a bunch of work done because i had nowhere to go 0 yeah i am saying that my struggles with covid or anything like that but he had a full body paralysis but i nah i am pretty sure that is what you are trying to say you are trying to relate to this guy it is kind of inspiring though that your man was able to have a reasonably kind of part of the reason why the film itself was so inspiring was because your man is kind of like he is not that likable he is kind of just constantly complaining and stuff but it is very kind of human you like you know sometimes you hear about a story that is an inspirational story but you are kind of like that is just showing off you know but like your man in the film like there is like a scene where he is like he is like watching tv and stuff and then someone turns off the tv by mistake and he kind of like call anybody to turn it back on he is kind of like 0 you goddamn this person is like around in his head and like yeah it is very kind of humanizing i guess these like yeah how can some people have like the most eventful life server i cannot get that that guy is like life seems pretty eventful yeah it is interesting that is okay man not that i want something like that in my life but who do you think has had the most eventful life i do not think we are meant to mention names but i do not know maybe neil armstrong he seemed pretty eventful yeah he was actually he was like on the moon and stuff yeah take care he went far out alright dude look at that it is going to be like julius caesar though like he was like he like conquered most of the world and then he like tried to be a politician and they killed him there it is going to be pretty free donald trump had a pretty eventful life considering he has been the host of a tv show and then the president i thought you could watch my what about your man reagan is not he like a tv star he was a movie star yeah he was in a bunch of cowboy movies what the hell that is wild he was not the good the bad and the ugly no no i do not what the fuck he wishes he wishes yeah it is pretty decent character he was just suitable for collecting stories yeah yeah there was this picture of him online of him with a monkey in a movie he was in back in the 50s movies would be the funniest things ever if somebody had a monkey and a monkey yeah simple times i guess yeah but it is kind of the idea you know when you think about people and they make movies they are monkeys and stuff maybe we should go back to that yeah i mean they had all those new planet of the apes movies where they had all the monkeys and stuff yeah but then we are the monkey is talking to the old movies i do not remember yeah yeah that is all they did they were much more intelligent to start it is pretty weird how like they kept using english yeah you think that you something a bit better did a figure had some kind of new monkey language or yeah right you know i heard that in some places in africa i know africa is a big fucking place but they use like they only have like a couple words for like a color 0 yeah that is crazy is not it yeah so like green and blue are like the same thing it is just like the one word for like boat i remember in college we watched a video that where there is a certain tribe that have 6 different words for the code of green depending on its shade what but like it is crazy because you what they can do is they have done studies where they show people to get people to pick out whether 2 colors are the same or different yeah i invite by matter of shade i guess like so they did show you like you know dark red versus light red you would say like different but these people from this tribe they have multiple words for green can like pick out various little differences in the shade what do people can not tell the difference from whoa which is crazy they can be like that one is definitely darker and then they are right and stuff do you think that is because their language has enabled them to visualize it better i think that must be the reason because like they probably have more reason to pay attention to color differences and stuff they can kind of make these things that nicely that is pretty wild i do not know maybe we should start doing that i have been more forward spirited rather than equilibrium yeah yeah did you ever like make it like a secret language roommate or something now there is a philosopher ludwig wittgenstein who was talking you wrote extensively about the problems of a private language and how it is impossible to have a private language but like what you mean well he taught that like i guess he did not mean a secret language between you and your friend but he taught that it was impossible to like have a secret language just for yourself because we need language as like a tool for social referencing and stuff okay so just one person yeah i guess that makes sense obviously annoying argument to try to like comprehend i am still not really great with it but like i do not like that guy same time no no not after he said that i do not know him but i do not like him yeah no i am personally you know there is this book that they found like a while ago i do not know when but it was like a really old book and it had like a weird language in it nice and they managed to decipher it and it turns out like it was like a weird coded language for like a cult but there was you yeah but there were some letters that were like did not mean anything but they are just thrown in there to turn you off and there is some letters yeah and there were some letters where like all like one symbols that look like a vowel actually only meant like one vowel which is very interesting to me that is weird that is like a that is kind of interesting i just they are trying to show people off but then like yeah what was it what were they writing about i do not know it was like the roles that you have to do for the cult and like what members like what a member it was kind of like a guidebook and stuff yeah yeah yeah sort of like a scout handbook i guess but like further weird thing i like the most culty thing i have ever seen is when i went to the initiation while in portugal 0 yeah and everybody i do not know what happened there but basically it is just like they do not know but it is basically just like an 8 story like tower but immersed in the ground so instead of like going up the tower you go down into like a ground they are holding their breath and so on this does not seem right they are already finished building it like that one was only built like 100 years ago just before like world war ii but there is a much older one because at the bottom like you get to like a cave and you go through the cave and then you can find like an even older version so i am not sure if that was like there before all like the rich portuguese people got there you know like before that that family set up their palace around there was that when you saw like a recreation or something what you mean recreation i do not know i do not know i bye bye it is just like 2 old wells down there but one is even older so i wonder if like that is like the well that they used to use and then they built a newer one so like how old is this we do not even know it is pretty crazy they are not even like 100% sure if it was for a cold but it looks kind of coldish to me yeah who else would be using it what do they do when they get to the bottom though that is what i do not know yeah it is a weird one they probably have you blindfolded and you have to stick something in your mouth or something yeah that is part of the rituals maybe it was a good dentist office that is why you put things in your mouth hey that is pretty cool that is like the coolest dentist you could ever go to if you have to go down like a tower like that on the ground yeah because i have a nerve is like a doctor has like a big castle 0 no that is i was just going to that would really scare people from the dentist yeah like a giant beautiful castle personally i have not gone to a dentist in like 10 years not really i have enough for like a checkup or anything no no no down dude it is just because i am sort of like well i have brushed my teeth you know i mean they are pretty yellow not following it i guess yeah so you know as long as they are not hurting like it is grand that is good you all right i mean it is kind of miserable going but yes it is all in the service of higher values everyone tells me i should do otherwise but i think the more people tell me that i should do it the more i do not want to do it just to piss them off well it is kind of like those things about slavery is really like everybody told me to give up and i kept on going and now look where i am yeah video one day when you have no teeth yeah i do not know i think like there is lots of things i have not done that lots of people would say like 0 you should really do that like like like goes into this kind of things are kind of like you know like watching eurovision kind of things both but i get a lot less suggestions for eurovision because i think most people go this is god awful that is true except for my girlfriend and her sister drills of eurovision i feel like yeah they look it they love it they love it i do not know i do not know everyone i ever talked to was big into your vision and they all like they are always kind of like either obsessed with it or they did not watch it at all like and you know my girlfriend she really liked like all the the slow ones you know where they have like a guy being like all professional and stuff but i just like it when you have got some crazy fucking shit out there yeah people are saying that there is like a song called hyper hyper by this band called ask him a cowboy they are like a german band and it is kind of like this song where it is like a mixture of like a 80s pop song with like a metal song we and then they did a music video where they dressed up in mullets and mustaches and stuff proper 80s kind of jumpsuits and stuff that is true everyone was saying it would be a kagashi revision song because it starts off kind of like a pop song and it goes into this deep metal section then back and forth and for the rest of the song my favorite one from the eurovision was moldova but mainly just because they decided to go with a violin a guitar rapping and an accordion now what is better with that thank you yeah i wish more rappers would do that yeah well i was in portugal and we were in this town called the cascai or cash guy or something like that but like they were all doing football volleyball the beach which is pretty badass but just from down from that there was a guy who was like playing on an accordion and he was like the best thing i saw all holiday he had like a small little dog like it was only this big and like a small little cat wearing pearls and the boogie i i guess yeah we should get into street performing we should be like you know those guys who are like statues but then they kind of like if you give them a coin and just do it down speed 0 we did that maybe i could be a fire reader that would be kind of cool that would be good on that yeah or one of those sword swallows yeah there is always a guy in graphics who is he knows him so much he has like a unicycle and he juggles knives but like you never see him do it cause you will spend the whole time there he is saying come on now guys make some donations there guys yeah i swear i will do it i swear i will do it yeah but like literally i can hear like call out people on the street he would be like you there in the blue hash come over here and check this out now you will not believe what you will see but yeah i always tend to meet people in intent around grafton street and like i will have to start meeting them somewhere else cause like your man is always there and you always just i was there once and he was setting up and so he had not built up a crowd yet he was literally just there like asking people to come over and stuff and like 0 man it was so yeah but he is doing what he loves you know he is just got to make the grind just harassing strangers yeah fair play to him and if he hits a stranger with a knife you know look that is a bad day but he is just going to pick himself up and go off what is the law around that can anyone just go around juggling knives with you out of like a pyramid i think you got a permit because me and the well i can not say his name but me and this one chap who was very he was small and has glasses we went to one of those busking agencies or something like that thank you very much like do you know an agency where you get like a busking license 0 nice but i forget where the hell it was but we went in and we walked 2.5 hours to get there you because we walked an hour in the wrong direction i will do it it was a half an hour walk yeah so it was yeah it took a while to get there and we finally got there we sat down and they said 0 just wait here they will be with you shortly and we finally got up to the person and they said well that is great and all the forms filled out and everything we just need to see your passport and he was like you and he was like my passport we were like yeah yeah your passport he is like 0 well i guess i have to come back another day and we were like 0 my god i remember we had to go for a fishing license once and then they were like 0 we have none left but it should be grand anyway so let us go and do it 0 is that when was that that was like 2 summers 3 summers ago we are meeting we were fishing at the daughter was at the shop at the daughter yeah we went down there to get one 0 yeah yeah and they were like you can just fish yeah that is cool just do it yeah it is okay one time me and another mate that you know were fishing down at the river and some lad came up to us and he was like do you have your licenses and we were like ah yeah yeah yeah we were like ah yeah yeah we just did not and he was like 0 that is good that is good and he did not even ask for us to show him he just asked if we had it was he an inspector or is he just some kind of random local i think he was just like a local fisherman but he was part of like the whole fishermen the community thing 0 yeah he probably would have been like a head honcho there you know he was an enforcer yeah yeah you would not want to mess with him now he was not you know he was 80 years old but he was packing like serious muscle you end up in the water man yeah last time i went fishing no i did not catch anything my dad caught 5 so it is kind of a shade and they were pretty big ones pretty big roach yeah i am not going to lie i was pretty jealous it sucks when you are sitting there for 56 hours and you do not catch anything but the person which you catch is like a shit ton the what am i doing wrong especially when you are doing like the exact same thing did you get the fish afterwards or did you channel it now we show them back you are on my face is kind of a weird thing that you kind of like yeah yeah yeah it is kind of weird when you think about it but once you catch a fish that goes right out the window because there is just so much room you are just trying to lose all morals really i saw some video of some guy who was like doing this bird thing where you would catch birds and that is and then he would like tag them and then check their wings and stuff he is like a biologist but then like somebody was like in the comments they were like imagine being the bird and then like trying to tell your friends afterwards what happened to you and they would not believe you you say you are going around one day and some dude grabs you and puts it to good thing on your leg and then like you get them putting them into like tubs and then weighing them let us do a version of like being like in a ufo or something yeah that is an interesting hypothesis like maybe there is like people out there who are like doing lots of humans like there is some species out there and then they are like i do not believe some no well let us be honest connor we both know that aliens and bigfoot are real yeah we have plenty of evidence but we can not disclose it in this current form but we have just evidence that is so convincing yeah yeah that is what they always kind of do though is not it it is like now you got to believe me now i can not show you this because it is classified you know those scam ads you got where they are like they are like telling you that they can make you a bunch of money with things like you got to keep on watching to the end of the video they can never give you the good information these are the 3 steps you have to take yeah but like i am going to leave that right to the end and i did from times where i have watched the whole video cause i find those kinds of scams really amusing and like what they usually always do is they are always like yeah there is 3 top tips to making 6 figures in a week or whatever and they are like they will like keep on watching for you to find out more information and then they will speak for 10 minutes down the bed some random stuff and then they are like now if you want to find out more information about these 3 tips they will not tell you the 3 tips they will like go to my website and like i feel like like obviously i know there is scams but whenever i watch them i always feel in my head that like it is kind of like that scientology thing like apparently there is all these different levels to it yeah they kind of get you there with the more money you spend like the more like like information they disclose to you about like the religion or whatever imagine you put a bunch of money into it and you realize it was all true you are like damn it all makes sense even the fact you get to spend money you are kind of like damn it all makes total sense and nobody will ever believe me 0 yeah what if like you know the whole like because people sort of know the story of it but what if like that is not the actual story what if there has got to be a reason why tom cruise is in it that is true he is not unfrizzed reasonable i think he is pretty badass i will give him that there is a i do not know i would i would not mind starting a cult one day yeah yeah but like i definitely have one of those coded books like that like that one that we were talking about you got it
