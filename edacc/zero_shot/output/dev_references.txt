5 thick slabs of blue cheese and maybe a snack for her brother bob we also need a small plastic snake and a big toy 0 and a big toy frog for the kids she can scoop these things into 3 red bags and we will go meet her wednesday at the train station yep that is good it is a very weird passage is not it quite i think it is designed to you know stretch your pronunciation skills okay so maybe we decided we would talk a bit about where we would want to go on holiday on holiday or yeah wh what what yeah what what would you like c 2 p 2 so i would love to visit africa because it is the only continent i have never visited i have actually been to africa and i have been to tanzania and i have been to malawi 0 it was yes it was just before the pandemic so and it had it it was a trip that had been planned for quite some time it it was with my parish and the they have a project there so they wanted to you know sort of how should i say strengthen their ties again with the project and we went there for a actually it was 2 projects it was 2 different things one was with a parish the other was with a home and they combined them together we went to tanzania 1st we spent i think it was a week and a half or something like that then we spent a few days in zanzibar and then we went on to malawi yeah and then a few months later covid struck and how how were tanzania and malawi that was very interesting it was a very different lifestyle very different way of living very different and even the environment in this side is very rural it reminded me a bit of how malta was you know ages a go possibly although you know i i barely remember it like that but yeah in what sense different lifestyle well it it it was much more relaxed it was much more in the evening for example everyone is just outside you know there it is not like now where everyone is just sitting in front of their tv 0 that is beautiful so that is beautiful yeah and then there were the savana the the not savana it is not savana it is the the safaris  in the in their you know jungles or savana yeah actually and that that that was really amazing what animals did you see did you have a chance to see yeah yeah we actually so we spent i think a whole day trying to chase lions in the sense trying to see lions and we did not manage but we saw elephants we saw giraffes monkeys one monkey almost attacked me but anyway 0 yes how come yeah i i was feeding them which is not supposed to be done but anyway it is my fault so yeah it is not it is not and you are not supposed to it is you know it is at your own risk and in fact it was at my own risk yeah because i was feeding one and then all the others came yeah so that is the thing yeah but yeah it was it was interesting what about you what what where would you like to go so you you said africa where where where are some sort of places you have been i have been outside of europe i have been to japan i have lived in japan for for 6 months and actually i would 0 wow si 6 months that is it is a very interesting place i would like to go back i i have very good memories from my time in japan i spent why were you in japan i was for 6 months i was living in tokyo and while i was there i visited kyoto hiroshima and osaka and osaka and i have i have heard of that i think i i know okay now i was going to visit tokyo now not osaka no no they are quite different anyway continue they are quite different  so okinawa is in the south of japan  in of japan and it is an island and it is it is tropical it is quite far away from mainland japan i mean from the main the main islands and it it is tropical the we the weather is hot always warm and apparently it is a ve it is very beautiful because it has white beaches and and it is a huge tourist attraction and osaka is a city in the place of jap in the south of japan actually next to kyoto is not the the best from the point of view of history and monuments but the food in osaka is very good ah the food yeah so what what is the food like actually i know that you know sort of the most famous food in japan is sushi but i think they actually have a lot of other things that people yeah do not really i think that take right i think sushi and sashimi are just the cliche but japanese do not spend the whole time eating sushi and sashimi as in the same way as italians do not spend the whole  time eating pizza and what is the reference between sushi and sashimi so so sashimi is the raw raw fish and okay is used in is one of the ingredients of sushi 0 okay so sashimi is the raw fish on its own without rice while sushi is it is sashimi on rice okay and so what what other food do they have then and even concerning fus sushi there is different kinds there that we can not find in europe because the there is much more variety of fish  so my my favorite one is the a particular kind of seal but i have never found it in europe and but you tried it there yes i tried it there it was really good and apart from from sushi i mean okay sushi is one dish one of their one of their dishes but then there is they have a 1000000 ways to cook fish also they they have a lot of ways to cook meat mostly griddle griddle meat  and they what struck me is that their cuisine is very light and light in what sense light in the sense that when a lot of it it you do not feel it heavy in your stomach okay in the uk it happens to me many times that i i feel it heavy on my stomach  while there when eating out very very rarely i i felt i felt it on my stomach could it be that they do not fry a lot then it could be although they they have templar which is again  a fried fish but even that it was it felt light in the sense probably  the i i think they have very high standard of cook food quality very very high quality standard for food okay well i mean i mean i have never been to japan i mean the the the the closest i have been is i have been to hong kong which was also amazing and yeah the food there againwas was wonderful i used to go to the university canteen i was there on a university placement and i used to go to university canteen and i think my most favorite dish was very simple just rice  what we here call bok choy if i am pronouncing it correctly i am not sure what it is exactly called and  chicken sorry no not chicken duck on the bone ah nice and they just chop it in front of you with a cleaver and serve it on on just white rice and with some soy sauce and it was delicious sounds really nice and then i went to sho how long yeah yeah 0 sorry how long have you spe spent in hong kong it was a month i i went there on a work placement kind of and it was over it was just in the run up to christmas so and and the thing is that struck me it is also quite not sure if it if it is classified as tropical but it is it was quite warm you know you see a lot of palms the university for example is gorge cause it is built along the side of the mountain so the the the 0 the campus of the university is basically you know in steps almost because it is it is it is going up to towards the mountain 0 basically so so you know there is a lot of stairways they have a lot of stairs huh everywhere and it was also the 1st place i think that i saw an outdoor escalator like a very long outdoor escalator an outdoor escalator yes as opposed to one that is in a shopping mall for example 0 and that is in the university campus well no no not just at the university campus even in in the streets that is what i meant like in the streets 0 that is what i meant in the university campus that is expected i mean you know are they very common the outdoor escalators ye yeah yeah yeah because because you have to because it is a lot of ups and downs and so it is it is it is the the the the island the main island is very hilly so yeah it is it is everything is you are going up and down up and down and and 0 sorry go on yeah yeah yeah ask are there a lot of skyscrapers there are depending on which island you go to yes eh the the harbor especially you see a lot in the harbor area and even even where all the buildings are quite high so  you know 101215 stories at least  ironically the the the streets reminded me a lot of malta to be honest because it is you know very narrow roads and high buildings obviously very high much higher buildings much higher yeah buildings but sort of the same kind of you know construction and what have you but yeah hong kong hong kong was was beautiful i did also manage to go a bit to see some of the adjoining islands that formed part of the the you know the what was you know archipelagos archipelagos you know or many well it is not something like archipelagos it is yeah archipelagos kinda way but yeah how many islands are there i have no idea there is quite a few i mean i think there is about 3 or 4 main islands and then there is the part that is connected to the mainland to mainland china  but then there is quite a few islands you know it it is and in fact there is a lot of ferry tours to individual islands and i i think i spent one or 2 days just going around some of the islands nice obviously during the weekend i could go there do things because i was mostly you know we were working towards a a competition so we had you know some very tight deadlines so sometimes i was even working saturdays  and but but it was a it was a fun trip yeah i have got phone memories there and how were you able to get by speaking english yeah yeah yeah hong kong is very english friendly it is it is it was a former colony so it is very englishized but at the same time you see a lot of the chinese culture  it was it is very very strong actually the chinese culture there there is lot of temples lots of you know their ways of living and what have you but it is very egli englishized so almost all the young people especially speak english  i was obviously in the university setting so yeah there is a lot of english there actually yeah how was it in japan with regard to english there is not it is not that easy in the sense that in in the university everyone spoke english however in well and in tokyo you could find people who who speak english but outside of the main city it is quite difficult to find an english speaker i mean it was similar in in hong kong as in in the main city you get by with english and when talking to youngsters but as soon as you go into the outskirts it is the same thing but the science at least were also mostly in english as well so because of that you know you get by yeah yeah they did have english science or okay science wri written in the in the latin alphabet okay okay and then after hong kong you went to shanghai well not not after but i did i did go to shanghai as well i went for a friend is wedding and that was actually quite interesting as well the food in shanghai was much more oily much sweeter  it was a bit too much for me in fact for example the hong kong cuisine i i it agreed more with me  but yeah it it it was no no shanghai was beautiful as well i mean it is a very westernized city as well shanghai  i did climb the the one of the tallest towers in the world the which the shanghai the shanghai tower and you can go up to the top floor and get the whole view i think it is i think it is the highest observation deck in the world how many meters is it i have no idea i would need to look it up but yeah it i i i think it is not the highest tower in the world but it is the highest observation deck okay if i am not mistaken in the world or at least it was when i went i do not know if there is anything changed since then all right and would you like to go back to hong kong yeah i mean i mean all these place i have i really enjoyed them and you know you can only see so much in in when you are there i mean it is it is it is i mean hong kong i had a month okay but still there was so many things i did not see yeah yeah yeah there and sa same with shanghai i was only there for a few days there were a lot of things in japan i did not see i would love to go back so what what would your most favorite part of japan be well i i loved kyoto because there is a lot of temples and a lot of history there  and tokyo is nice because it is huge and there is a lot of every quarter in tokyo is different so so you you can basically find everything you can find the temples you can find the westernized quarter you can find the the fish market  so you can find anything nature is really beautiful especially in the autumn they have the they there are there are if you get a bit away they have a lot of maple trees and they all turn orange in the autumn and it is  wonderful and unfortunately i missed the cherry blossom in in spring cause i i went there in may when when  it was too late for that i i would love to visit okinawa which is the the south of japan the very south at the southmost and i would like to visit hokkaido which is the northmost point  and yeah japan is very long so the hokkaido at the north is very cold apparently while okinawa is is tropical while tokyo was was was very very mild summer was quite hot but autumn was extremely mild is the city walkable or do you have to take public transport no it is huge so you you okay you can not walk around you you need to take public transport and is it efficient or it is very efficient and there is eh you can get basically everywhere by metro or by train the only problem is that the metro shut between midnight and 5 so  you have those 5 hours where there is no public transport or well no metro probably  there are local buses but i did not i never tried because it it is less easy to navigate for for me who i did not speak japanese but but yeah the the trains are very efficient they are always on time and and there is train stations everywhere okay i think with that we can wrap up yes this is c 2 p one turning off the recording (EDACC-C01-00)
0 ready you have to click 0 yeah 0 hi okay so my participant number is c 8 p 2 and i think so i have not checked so i am just trusting you on this so i have to read the following passage out loud okay do it one more time please call stella ask her to bring these things with her from the store 6 spoons of fresh snow peas 5 thick slabs of blue cheese and maybe a snack for her brother bob we also need the small plastic sn snake and a big toy frog for the kids she can scoop these things into 3 red bags and we will go meet her wednesday at the train station 0 hi my participant number is c 8 p one and this is a following passage please call stella ask her to bring these things with her from the store 6 spoons of fresh snow peas 5 thick slabs of blue cheese and maybe a snack for her brother bob we also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids she can scoop these things into 3 red bags and we will go meet her wednesday at the train station nice so we were just talking about how i just literally crashed zoom trying to change my pronouns i still do not know how zoom works even after all this time i tried to have it because i had it with my institutional account but every time i tried to change it they said that i need to change my email or link my personal email to change the zoom account and this has been going for around a year since i joined the uni yes that is why i prefer to use teams cause you can search people up and just call them  much easier than like creating a link and then send a link and then enter password yeah sure and all the blah blah blah yeah that it is not that easy to understand anyway but i think teams is not that good sometimes i guess yeah they have got their pros and cons 0 i have some of some people that said like no i cannot join teams i do not know how that works like it is really you just have to click the link so easy some people do not even use i know some older professors who do not even like to use emails at all it takes them like a month 2 plus so what they do i do not know they do everything on paper do not even know how they do like statistical analysis and stuff i thought you were saying like i think they do not use email yeah if you do not use email do you do you use r like if you teach psychology do you use r you send everything by post by pigeons i mean you can still have post here so that is a good thing but no yeah we had this conversation before yeah that is still that is a thing what sending the review by post yeah yeah what still like lots of you can send lots of things by post yeah even the journal subscriptions they still have like the paper versions 0 yeah like paper version you know like the review of the manuscript that you are working on sending it corrections by post had writing things no i hope not i hope not but i know that my partner unidentifiable not identifiable he has help someone in the uni struggling with excel 0 okay and they send some sort of random email like please i need some help like just filter and stuff in excel and stuff and then they pay you just i know that it is not just for doing this i want to get paid helping you filter out sheets i love spreadsheets over here not good if i am not very good at excel but i do love filtering but you can do filtering in many other things instead of excel i do not know if you received some sort of excel on that kind of things in office when you were in high school  i do not know i have never learned i have never learned properly never ever no i have never learned properly i used to have a course literally every every term or every year when i was in high school we got this computational skills course that you need to pass and you have like 2 hours of that yeah how to turn on the computer and which make you prepared no it was more like filtering the i had classes like that where they they are like this is the start button you need to press the start button and i have to log in and then this is how to use the mouse yeah yeah but then i do not know it it was more advance and not they tried to teach us how to use ma macros or macros in excel and how to use the 0 i do not know what that is and there is another another stuff but i do not remember that it was really useful for big data sets that is not excel but it was purple i just remember the icon that was purple i never understood it  no no no no another one for really big data sets do not know but i do not remember i can only use r and from from a start when i was born i was using r exactly when i was born cause i was genius yeah still can not do anything yeah but i am trying to learn python cause every single if you look at the cvs of every single person out there they know at least like 3 languages and a few very stupid only one thing it is pretty basic that everybody knows i think i think you need to understand that you already speak 2 human languages yeah it does not matter little bit like everything i do not think that is such a big deal cause a lot of people from like mainland european countries they speak at least 2 or 3 languages at home anyway and like yeah if you if for example like if your mom if your mom and dad from different countries and they also speak english then that is 3 already okay yeah like my my partner he want to i do not know how many languages he speaks yeah how many languages just does he speak he well there is native german and then but the local dialect swiss german and then he also learned english from from from a very young age and because it is switzerland you still have to learn at least 2 other language that they speak in country like french or italian or something else and then he went to norway and then he learned so he knows i do not know even i do not even know how many languages i think depends if you qualify and then you categorize how m much you know from a language because no matter how many languages you speak it does not matter no not how you speak but how fluent you are basically yes how fluent you are  yeah and the proficiency also yeah it is not like you know or you do not know it is on a spectrum everything is on spectrum the same with pythons and all all the other languages i guess i am somewhere right here so so about what but i think well what what i was hearing the other day when we got this big consortium meeting all about speaking programming languages it depends on how you do you understand the basis of programming itself because even i think python and r was are 2 languages are have stayed some sort of on a common ground yeah cause yeah there is many others that just have evolved or disappeared or you know it but it is a combination of many other languages  yeah  i do not know there is a the conference i am going to they have got like another version of it so it is like acm but they have got another version and it is for linguistics only and that is that looks quite fun but i can not and what is that languages again it is acl advanced something for linguistics and yeah i am quite interested but i can not go to 5 conferences in one year it is way too many i mean you could if everything is online it is only i only part of it no bad practice yeah i just do not want to go travel around cause so that is like one of the perks for what we do we get to travel i will get we get we can get paid for as long as it do not go to like 10 when you ask for money for 10 things well yeah  but you know know everyone that has got into phd sometimes they are like yeah this is kind of the the thing travel and meet people but we are not experienced anything throughout the pandemic and i am like 0 okay yeah yeah i think i got quite lucky i guess for i graduated undergrad when pandemic happened and then i got into phd when pandemic sort of not not over but a lot more loose than before so i think i got the best yeah end of both deals i experienced the pandemic also studying yeah i feel quite bad for the year above me they are sort of just stuck at home for like the entire year yeah yeah that does not help at all depends if you like it i like to be stuck at home i do like it yeah but i mean from the educational experience 0 yeah definitely it is totally different level yeah i am a a very strong believer that any some sort of commun communal or community experience based on the education and ev even the work  everything is just for the social interaction because you can work by your own 15 minutes it is 15 minutes no yet we have still 5 minutes to go yes what else we can talk about i do not know because they have problems like these things of what is the memory of your childhood and like i am not talking about memories of my childhood i mean it is the memories of your childhood to be fair wait l like a therapist when where when you were a kid what kinds of games did you use to play is there anyone or one that you remember well i was a strange kid yeah but i to that question was like did i used to play i do not think i used to play any games i still do not play games you counted the stairs and the stars but no i was a very strange kid i do not i do not know probably yes we are always strange in our in that own way 0 another one did you have a favorite book of film or tv show or cartoon as a child what was i used to watch quite a lot of tom and jerry nice i do not remember what i used to like 0 yeah i used to watch a lot of dragon ball z i was because it is your that was the only thing that passes in your tv that repeated over and over and over again literally 0 is that why you like anime no no not at all because i did not i never i did not know that that was anime but that time to be honest we would just watch it with my brother because that was something that was playing on the tv on a sunday morning instead 0 of watching the mass or people talking about many of the things that we did not understand so we watched that cartoon because that was the only free cartoon that we can watch  back then i do remember that that was a very popular anyway but i was not really into it but i remember the kids around me they were pretty interested in similar shows but i was not i just never i have never really been very into it so now i see it i am like i do not get the hype but it is so popular i do not get the hype i think there is many cultural perspective of why that is popular or not but at least in latin america no no i do not know we did not know that it was anime but i think it is a very different format it is a very different format yes and then you got this this this cartoons of i think is dexter or dexter the the magical grand grand something 0 i thought you mean like the detective show no no there is another one that is in cartoons really 2 different then or bob square bo square pants but sponge blad i know it wait it is bob a square spongebob bob sponge spongebob squarepants pants yes that is what i meant very long name that kind of shows that there was the one that used to show on tv or power rangers but that is not a cartoon but i think that was pretty popular i remember me and my brother is squeezing just to see power rangers we watched do you know bob the builder yes but that was quite annoying for me and i was it is very annoying yeah we were watching it in class to study like gender stereotypes bob the and then like our teacher i was at school i was like i was doing and our our teacher he literally brought a cassette cause it was so old that it was on cassette and then he has he also had to brought he also had to bring a cassette player to show us yeah yeah yeah look at that no no probably i am i was already like in middle school when bob happened spongebob happened or probably i yeah yeah yeah because only remember the sensation of why 0 the shows about the trains i do not know you know like there is a really creepy train a train with a face on it yes no i do not understand children like if i were a kid and i watch those i am going to get nightmares yes for sure hey arnold hey arnold was okay but i do watch quite a lot of detective shows and still okay i think like which ones kinda messed up for a child like even for the normal shows that we watch at our age but i was watching it quite young age do not know if that is legal or not identify yeah well you were mentioning that is okay that is okay well we are almost done we may like 13 seconds and then we are done and hopefully and then can we do a countdown like what a countdown 109 0 no it is not 10 yes 151413 it is like a rocket launch like what rocket launch ah no but already it is 10 past 4321 that is it that is it let us stop with the recording (EDACC-C04-00)
all right i am participant c 13 p one and i am participant c 13 p 2 okay now i have to read out this text so again  participant c 13 p one reading this out please call stella ask her to bring these things with her from the store 6 spoons of fresh snow peas 5 thick slabs of blue cheese and maybe a snack for her brother bob we also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids she can scoop these things into 3 red bags and we will go meet her wednesday at the train station that was a bit of a tongue twister your turn beautiful yeah please call stella ask her to bring these things with her from the store 6 spoons of fresh snow peas 5 thick slabs of blue cheese and maybe a snack for her brother bob we also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids she can scoop these things into 3 red bags and we will go meet her wednesday at the train station all right so now we can just go into a normal conversation so okay which we have not had all day so we can actually have a nice relaxing conversation right now so how is work actually all right  a bit boring i mean i like when it is kind of boring because i do not especially like when it is early in the morning i am so tired  so i do have to like so go for a social support with anyone today  plus we had like 4 people in the shift 0 okay and then like who was there becca becca jamie and maya they are different people and i just stayed in the service  too and i did some like i do not know like admin work ppe like ppe check and i send it to our manager i also spoke to the manager she came over and we discussed like there is an incident a little bit she asked like how this affected me and and i also like ask her if i can get some extra shifts because i have a little bit more time now  with like finals over yeah yes i did a shopping for one person and  m mostly i just yeah i did some just admin work and we had a bit of a laugh with the staff  it is actually nice  yes and it always feels really weird for me when i am like on a day shift from 9 through 5 or 10 till 6 whatever  because i am so used to like being on a sleepover so just staying in the service for the whole day whole night until the next day and like i just kind of habit by habit wanted to sign the handover sheet like because we have this safe keys that we always  give to each other for from like one person finishing sleepover is giving to the person starting the sleepover and then and i and we need to sign that you get got the keys and i just wanted to sign it by just because i do it usually  but i was like no actually i can go home tonight so that was and that was nice yeah i know i was going to mention it because usually every time you told me that you are going to go to work it is like because of the whole 24 hour thing i expect that okay right now you would still be at work and then tomorrow in the afternoon you would say 0 i got i got free now i am free  but it is weird that you started in the morning and you are free now which is how the the average person works with with with you it is the 24 hour shift so yeah that is yeah my friend at work she said that last month she did 8 sleepovers  so she is knackered but she is happy that she is going to have like a lot of money now  yeah yeah true she can probably buy more and and there was actually another sleepover available tomorrow because  someone cannot do it and i was really tempted to take it just like you know for extra cash  but i can not tomorrow because i am seeing like 2 other friends tomorrow  and we planned that a long time ago so i am not going to you know back out back you know just change your plans because it is very difficult to  to to find the same time that will be available for everyone i mean you picked up quite a few shifts anyway so i mean i think it should be fine yes yes and you do not want to over tire yourself because then it would be difficult to do all that dissertation work yeah but i was thinking maybe actually because i am always hesitant to pick up shifts because i am thinking because in my mind i keep thinking 0 i do not want to go for the whole day to work but then  i am like but it is not a sleepover it is just like a day shift and i can also like yeah just pick up 4 hours or 3 hours if i do not want to do the full 8 hours did you do that too yes jesus i did not know that yeah there is no there is so flexible now because like they are desperate for people to help to work would that also apply like if i am working there and then if i just want to go yeah pick up w wow you wow okay so jeez i did not know that i thought the minimum was like an 8 hour shift like even if it is not 9 to 5 but 8 hours minimum i mean that is like officially but it is it is really but all these things we have to like sorry for cutting you off but all these things  would have to be decided like a the month before right like when they ask you to give your times and blah blah blah and then you fill out no no you can like you know today i looked at the rota what shifts were outstanding what was available  and i and you know i was like actually i could work next week this extra  shift and i just emailed my manager about that and added it to the rota so yeah that is cool yeah so i so i have my maybe like like in between my trips in june  i could pick up some extra because i do not want to be i do not want to feel so financially insecure  especially like with the trips i am going to spend more money on you know going for a dinner or whatever like having restaurant restaurant food or like going for a drink  so it is going to be extra costs so yeah   yeah fair enough yeah also because you are going to come later tonight what do you want i can not remember what we want to add to the curry i am going to go to the shop was it peppers bacon and whatever 0 i will take some bacon 1st and and baby corn yeah yeah yeah peppers baby corn the green beans you mentioned yes we can have that and huh pineapple yeah yeah if we can get a cheap can of that yeah i mean maybe because like the whole pineapple actually is usually quite cheap to buy sometimes it is like i know but it can be a nuisance well i have a sharp knife so i could manage it is a yeah but you are going to be making the other stuff as well so it will take time i will see how i feel  because if i and the extra pineapple like the fresh one  will be more like firm the the one from the can is quite like soft and mushy in a way if you know what i mean yeah so you know i mean it should be it should be fine but i think yeah yeah i think that should be fine mostly i i do not even know how that brand is going to taste at tesco  because i have never tried that that yeah that thai curry paste before i have tried different other thai curry paste but not like the tesco brand one  and they are all different so  yeah let us see how that is okay so what did you do today so far i was at the cafe with my thesis partner we were just  working on stuff i think it was pretty decent to be honest like even though i told you you know somewhere in the middle like things were getting quite slow and everything because of the assessments now and it is still slow like in the sense that it it is quite delayed but certain things that we want to get done when we do meet each other we are able to get it done to at least some extent which is which is good  it is not like we just sit there and nothing happens so it is it was quite productive i would say today hm got some code running code it is on calltracks yeah 0 okay yeah i thought it was our not not not not not our studio no no okay just to calltracks and what code do you need to use there and as we wanted to do this one thing where if you are playing a if you open up a questionnaire and then you are playing some track  we did not want the we did not want people to have the option to like move around the track like well if it is a 32nd track they can just skip wherever they want  i wanted it to be like an autoplay thing so the minute you open it the the the thing the song just starts right  and we do not want we do not want to let participants go to the next one without completing that so until that song finishes  well let me rephrase when the song finishes then the button appears to go next 0 right okay yes 0 that is practical yes so there is 0 that is practical is some code that you need for that which yeah we we checked up online and there was somebody that was asking about videos we did not we did not have to do anything with videos but we used the same thing but with an audio file   then what else happened yeah i mean that was most of the most of the day so far and and then after that went to the gp got my knee checked up and they said i should just go for physiotherapy and everything else he said was i do not know stuff i ge i guess i already knew or maybe he was confused i am not sure because he did not seem to know too much about what was going on i tried to explain it as as well as i could telling him how how it is you know it is a little y you know sometimes i have trouble walking and i do not know  what is going on exactly and then i guess he did not know what was going on either so no that is fine he he said that you know just give it another couple of weeks it might take a little longer to heal up but he did like i said recommend physiotherapy for for later on maybe not now but he said that you know again if you he is like even if it gets better like what if you want to do roller skating or rollerblading later on  and what if the what if it is fine and then what if the whole thing it happens all over again so he is like i would give that he is like the waiting list is long but at least you could try it and i was like yeah maybe  other than that i am just in my dorm right now and i am going to head out in a while maybe like half an hour later  for drum rehearsals how long was the appointment the appointment not too long i mean i i i was called at i mean the appointment time was 330 i got there just before that like literally a minute  or 2 before that probably called in at around 340 and i was in for about 10 minutes maybe i think he was trying to find out other causes he was asking me 0 do you have this problem that problem i was like yeah a bit of this a bit of that but i was like i do not think it has got anything to do with this particular problem yeah and i was explaining w why exactly he looked at my previous reports as well and then yeah and and of course i do not blame him he is trying to figure it out so obviously he is going to ask  more questions well but yeah i i so i can not say it was a complete waste i got some information out of it but  i was just hoping to get a little more insight into what was going on  it is a confusing thing so i i do not i do not really know so we will see what happens yeah after a couple of weeks was it that is it the same the gp that you always see or was it a different one no i mean i have only seen 2 people including him so far  so i have only been to the gp once before and that was some other guy  and then this guys was was different yeah they seemed all right pretty chill and everything like that it is not like he was trying to dismiss me and just like finish off the appointment i just i guess he just did not know what to to really say because i mean the way even when i explained it to him he told me that you know this this should have been gone that they yeah you should not have pain right now but he well he said you know for some people it is different the you know healing processes take the healing process can take longer so he said that  that might just be your case but of course he was not a 100% sure so we will see in a couple of weeks time  nothing bad though really yeah but yeah like i said and then after this in a while i am going to leave and then i have drum rehearsals and that is for like 2 hours and then after that we can meet and make the thai curry do you want to do you want to continue watching what was the movie rat race or that which one yeah either i i am cool with either i think i actually have a couple of other movies i think  i already seen half of it so i can not remember yeah i mean honestly either let us see how the what what what the whatever the curry smell inspires yeah  because rat race is more of like a comedy kind of thing yeah yeah a bit of comedy a little action  a little bit of mystery as well because you do not know who is who is really going to i mean how it is going to end yeah and dirty dancing it is like a romantic movie dirty dancing yeah do you like actually do you like because you never mentioned about any when you talk about movies like you never  really mention any like rom com romantic comedies or other romantic movies yeah like watch comedy or some kind of yeah i think i usually to prefer comedy with i do not mind some rom com like they are fine  some of them are i can not really i do not have any at the top of my mind right now but some of them are great it is just that with me i i would be more inclined towards just comedy or just mystery  or maybe horror or those kinds of genres 0 horror yeah are you not scared of horrors what are you not scared of horrors i am that is why i love it right that is the whole point like if you get if if you just sit with the big tv screen or or on your laptop as well and you watch something which is under the category of horror and you just sit there i mean i mean you do not enjoy that  the whole the whole joy is to to to to watch something and then like like scream but can you and you watch it like yourself or would you prefer to no no are you crazy no no yeah holy shit yeah okay no i i would have to watch it with somebody i mean i i i could watch it alone i just prefer  not to there is more of a with a pillow yeah there is more of i like the harmony like when you are watching it with a group and everybody is scared you know unless i do not like watching it with the kind of people that are that just are like you know the every time something scary is going to come they try to divert themselves or they try to say something out loud to to to reduce the creepiness i do not like that i like everybody to scream at once yeah and i i sometimes like be rude and if comment during the movie and like there is some there would be like some kind of like mystery scene and they would like make joke about it yeah and like ruin the the vibe the atmosphere  of the scariness kind of yeah not not that happened to me actually in a cinema  we were watching it was kinda horror but also not like not like a typical horror  i think it was called heritage or  something like that i do not know if you have heard i have heard of it yeah i do not yeah know it was actually a great movie but i my friends started sometimes would make some comments and that would make me laugh and then i guess i got into this vibe as well and i was start making i was i yeah i am kinda a hypocrite here because i started making these jokes too obviously everyone yeah but yeah no i have more to say on this but i think we have gone above well above the 15 minutes i forgot 0 okay but i am going to stop this recording but we will continue this conversation on call right now okay (EDACC-C07-00)

is that i mean realistically i would rather go to the beach today yeah the weather is actually quite nice i feel like we have not had sun like this we had like one day of sun in like 3 weeks you know i mean obviously but it has been i would rather go right now as well as everybody is going there and a little bit grim yeah especially in this time staying inside yeah that is true i mean we could just go after this you know what is stopping us i mean we could after a after this yeah but and i will say everybody is like saying 0 yeah go bourbon and all that stuff like nobody really cares people going bourbon 0 my god that sounds atrocious yeah it sounds really grim i would not want to go there another right another night at rascals no never again i know you are a big promo you are the big big promoter there but yeah of course well the big promoter is right here with me but i mean please do not ever mention that ever again yeah no well it is kind of funny to think they will be analyzing this conversation but anyway yeah i am seeing a great i am seeing a great question here i am not going to lie it is what is the question it is is there a particular food you used to like as a child i am quite tempted by that ooh okay tell me about a particular food you used to like when you were a child then i mean i mean i mean depends when cause i think when i was in ukraine i would definitely say it was like the dumpling yeah is like more polish i would say well actually are they like all these all these all these dumplings of eastern european origin i mean they are just all just realistically they are all just like lamb or beef or pork with stuffed with herbs which i mean depends obviously by differently depending where you are from but it is realistic realistically that with very thick outer crust and most of the time you will have cream sour cream with them and they are so good they are delicious that does sound pretty good if i had not just eaten an entire pepperoni pizza i could definitely scran a few of those how do you not have that you must have that in romania like some form or version of it they are not really big when they are dumplings actually are they not yeah they have well the closest thing we have is something called but it is not like a dumpling it is like wrapped in those like banana leaves you know yeah so it is like it is beef or mints or whatever but it is wrapped in the leaves and then you banana leaves not banana leaves i do not know why i said that the cabbage right sort of yeah cabbage cabbage leaves and like you boil the leaves and you cook the meat and then you wrap them in and it is like a a dumpling but with a leaf on the outside and you eat that with like sour cream and stuff and that is pretty good 0 my god that is like that is like what we eat at christmas for some reason i have no idea it is not a christmas food but it is just my grandmother my dad okay the way my grand my mom is mother makes them reminds my dad a lot of the way his mom used to make them that is and he is always like 0 you can not find them authentically made here so it does not bother me she likes the way she does them so he will just eat like loads of those at christmas like i have never we have not done a christmas turkey for like 10 years it is always just a bunch of romanian food for some reason yeah you you watch die hard as well for christmas which is like honestly the best family tradition like who cares yeah no it is great it started like maybe like 5 or 6 years ago my sister was like 0 let us watch die hard and then i said i would never watched it everyone goes 0 so we watched die hard and yeah it is it is the best tradition but i think my favorite how is that is that just a you thing being like very special i think it is quite an american thing watching die hard it is like you watch home alone or the the scrooge mcduck one or whatever that is called or die hard but i remember a few years ago there was one time where we watched die hard one and everyone kinda like fell asleep from a food coma and then my dad was like okay he just put on die hard 2 so we watched die hard one at like 40 clock and then about 20 minutes into die hard 2 i just passed out and fell asleep on the couch and this 630 i wake up around midnight and i am like what is going on and my dad is like 70% of the way through die hard 4 he just watched like all 4 of them back to back everybody else is asleep he was just there like 0 well time for die hard 30 well time for die hard 4 he is an absolute specimen he should not be let out of the house yeah i dunno that was that was a great christmas i think that was that was like the 1st corona christmas he just fully lost it do you think actually like fucking lost it throughout corona it is like 0 my god almost almost certainly went a tad insane i mean any man would lo would is insane when they watch die hard 4 i am not going to lie yeah you can actually watch bruce willis get like more and more bold as the films go through it is quite fun you can just track the male pattern baldness track it on the tv screen 0 i just saw someone outside with the new have you seen the new like airpod headphones what no never in my life you should look them up after this but they are really gucci they are like they they have that like old like 80s fancy headphone like hi fi design but they they are like 600 quid as well but apparently they are really good but also you look like a complete tool wearing them i think people said that about airpods everybody is wearing that right now that is true that is that is very true like have you ever like people like people people when they 1st came out people mocked them so hard and now they are just everywhere i was one of them i used to mock them everywhere and here i am to be fair i remember when i 1st got airpods it is like cause i tried to like like back then beats had some like wireless earbuds and stuff and they have probably gotten a lot better now but they are like sony ones back in 2016 or whatever they were complete shit they were falling out of your ears yeah they were terrible and they were painful they hurt they were and you get airpods and it is just like boop connected to my phone easy peasy exactly and as well as that like 0 my god like you can literally like do walk i think like 10 meters something like that and nobody cares it is going to be fun yeah remember that brings up remember the whole like google glasses thing that came out that whole thing that was so dumb yeah i never i never worked out why that did not actually become a big thing remember smosh made a video where they like roasted yeah the hell out of it but then they never actually like made them probably cause you number one probably like a tool just wearing that and 2nd of all you just i am also almost certain that like every single person or the like lab rats they had doing them got some kind of like retinal cancer or something probably they probably have like cataracts google google they they like their vision was just ruined and google probably hushed them just no there is no google glasses cause nobody is tried to like do it ever since yeah they did look pretty dumb i mean yeah they looked really you look like an absolute tool walking around with that but it is fine i am not going to judge see what else we have in the old prompt section some beautiful questions that i am seeing did you have a favorite book or film or tv show or cartoon as a child what was it about ah absolutely adventure time supremacy all the way honestly still adventure time to this day to this day adventure time supremacy it is pretty great it is amazing when have you ever seen like as a kid watching that coming back from school i just watched that that was amazing adventure time i read this book when i was a kid called do you ever read this jay the phantom toll booth i have heard of that i have heard of that it is like a very very vaguely it is very classic like 8 year old boy book but it is super fucking jarring because it is basically like this kid that goes into like an alternate dimension where maths there is like a bunch of weird superheroes that all have like math power he is like a math wizard and stuff yeah and there was this one kid who would just go around like floating in mid air of course and the main character sees him and he goes why are you floating in mid air and then he says you know how when you grow up as you get taller your like vantage point is constantly changing throughout the years cause you are getting taller and taller and he says he comes from a species where everyone starts with their head where up and your legs just go down and eventually you touch the ground like it is like 0 that makes way more sense because now i always look at things the same way i thought that was such a weird idea i am just going to like try i am just going to imagine like a like a primary school teacher trying to explain to the kids that this is somehow normal just to any child yeah imagine being a primary school teacher and all these like 6 year old boys who will grow up to be d one athletes they are just like hovering way above you and you are like it is like what are you doing like imagine like that child is like imagine like the children are like super small like it is going to be like a foot level of the d one yeah just playing football with their head floating about yeah wait but what what was like your i i can see you as a very like big movie man what was like your like formatting movie as a kid as a kid i do not know it is quite tough i feel like i probably did watch loads of movies as a kid but a lot of them were like dumb like disney films and stuff yeah you know i am not gon i used to love you know the the jim carrey movie the mask 0 the mask was so good i found that so funny i think i have watched that like 20 times over the years it is amazing the scene where he starts dancing and does like the little conga routine it is just 0 my god yes 0 it is just lose it every single time and the soundtrack to it is so good soundtrack is amazing yeah it is great and he has so many goofy noises and movements and stuff with hammers and his explosions but it is like it reminds me remember i remember watching as a kid like the whole like i remember my teacher showed me the the what was it again the wizard of oz and i real and i learned like 10 years later that apparently like all 0 yeah the characters got massive amounts of skin cancer from the mercury in the paints because the lighting was so poor 0 the actual actors yeah that is kind of fucked up and like got like massive amounts of radiation damage i can not believe that musical is still running wicked wicked 0 my god yeah i remember watching that at the west end i like i remember being a kid walking around london and you see the ads for that there is that and the lion king who is like how can there still be demand how has everyone not watched them already but i think it is such a cult thing it is like it is like disney movies like people will just rewatch them whenever so but like in the in the play industry yeah they just have to like keep it yeah i guess so they are like because you do not see that in countries that just like are not like english speaking like you only ever see that in like  english speaking countries like when have you ever seen that in like greece the musical like americans americans i went to see i went to see a performance of mama mia in greece and it was just like the gayest thing i have ever seen they went super camp with it it was hilarious because you had this like i love it tiny blonde greek girl and there were like 40 dudes because you know how like each of the 3 dudes that thinks it is her dad it is like slightly different yeah like colin firth or colin farrell or whatever is like a businessman and then one of the guys is like a hippy and then one of and then this one like guy who is like a bit normal and it always hints that this dude is like clearly the father but they just never say it yeah of course i might be completely misremembering mama mia but that is what happened in the play anyway no i think and i think that i think that was what happend it was super funny because it was just like in this play it was basically 3 gay dudes all dressed in like sequins with one was like fully purple one was fully that is awesome green and one was fully pink that is so awesome and they would just do all these dances on stage it was hilarious but and it must have just like did you did you understand all of it or were you just it is like 0 yeah well because a lot of it was just they were just singing the songs 0 were they singing in english or were they like adapted to greek i think i think most of them they adapted to greek but like the famous ones they kept in english like mama mia they sang in english and what is the one they sing when they are in the ocean like do not go like that lay all your lay all your love on me i think that one they kept in english i do not know finding nemo i do not know finding nemo that is a weird that is a movie i have not watched since i was like a little kid and all i remember right it is you have to watch it it is like a fever dreamy details did you ever see in finding nemo in the swedish one at the at the very end no i have never actually seen the swedish version of finding nemo i have not either but it is this whole thing at the end i think it i think it is at the end it is like it is like the end of it it just says slut and that is the end of it slut it is just in one frame it just says the word slut in the ocean it is amazing is that how you say the end in swedish probably not it probably means something like it is imagine that we are watching a really emotional kids movie and all of his family dies looking for his wife he is met a really like special friend and now it is just like it just says slut at the end excellent from and with that that has been 15 minutes i think we can call it a day excellent conversation it is like a i feel like i am on a joe rogan podcast yeah yeah that was good fun all right come back round i will finish the recording now toodles toodles bye bye (EDACC-C06-00)
hi i am c 7 p one hi i am c 7 p 2 okay so here is the passage please call stella ask her to bring these things with her from the store 6 spoons of fresh snow peas 5 thick slabs of blue cheese and maybe a snack for her brother bob we also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids she can scoop these things into 3 red bags and we will go meet her wednesday at the train station please call stella ask her to bring these things with her from the store 6 spoons of fresh snow peas 5 thick slabs of blue cheese and maybe a snack for her brother bob we also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids she can scoop these things into 3 red bags and we will go meet her wednesday at the train station okay great okay actually i will ask you a different question this time if you could go on holiday anywhere where would you go and why that is that is like the most difficult question ever okay because i want to go everywhere but i guess maybe some specifically famous place places that i can think of that i have not been to like in terms of i think they refer to them as the 7 wonders of the world so for example i have been to the pyramids but i want to go to 0 wow really the great wall of china and surprisingly i have gone to paris before but i have not actually been to the eiffel tower so that too 0 but wait no i am remembering there is there is 2 different sets there is the 7 ancient wonders of the world and then there is the the other set so i think the eiffel tower right is in the newer one but then what would you call it the pyramids and some other places are in the like ancient version but yeah places places like that have you seen the stonehenge no i have not that is in where was stonehenge again i have forgotten but yeah i i know which place you you are referring to yeah because i think that is also a wonder of the world like some kind of mystery i mean no i i have not seen it either but like i have seen tours starting from london to stonehenge so maybe one day  so what was egypt like egypt is cool i yeah i liked it cuz there was lots of cool historical things to see i know that is a such a dull answer but yeah cuz as well as the pyramids and the sphinx we also went to a couple of museums as well and we also went to a bunch of restaurants and tried the local cuisine and yeah it was just all round a good trip okay egypt because i i would like to go there but i do not know have not had the chance but yeah it looks really interesting and like it is kind of a historical artifacty place because yeah i mean those like ancient egyptians were so smart yeah there were so many what what do they call it like they invented lots of things and made lots of cool discoveries during  during their time yeah okay i guess i should go now where do i want to go on holiday i mean okay i honestly want to go to egypt and then yeah like it just seems really cool and i have not i actually have not been to africa at all or  so yeah i would say that is like seems like a good starting place i want to go to egypt and then maybe iceland because i always see those really pretty pictures on the internet of like 0 the aura borealis 0 yeah yeah the aura and also like they have just really really weird looking naturey places like they have an ocean no they have a beach that is just black sand no way i have never heard of this before yeah yeah no no no they really they have like the craziest they have the craziest nature things and then they also have like what do you call it like volcanoes and i do not know it just looks really strange and like really magical so that is why i want to go there that is so cool no i i have to go there now you know like honestly i think it looks just so amazing and but i i mean i have so many places that i want to go to i also want to go to like india or like uzbekistan or like i do not know again more ancient civilization places with nice architecture i have not been to the middle east so i should go to the middle east yeah there is there is too many places to go the world is a big place yeah i know wait what was i going to say so do you want to ask the question now okay i will ask you maybe about a favorite book or film or tv show that you had as a child or more recently or something okay what should i say okay i will just go with movie okay right i used to be obsessed with the movie matilda you know that one right 0 yeah i i think you mentioned this before yeah like with ms trunchbull and stuff but yeah no i was so obsessed with that movie like i would watch it every single day because that was still the dvd time so i would just like you know how kids are like i would just come home every day and put matilda on and watch it again and again and again so yeah i really liked that movie i should actually rewatch it it has been very long since i have rewatched that one and but it is like such a heartwarming story you know i i get you have you have you seen it but yeah what what were you going to say have you seen it 0 no yeah i have seen matilda a couple of times yeah it it was just when you when you mentioned dvds it was making me think how yeah it was not too long ago that we still watched stuff on dvds or even vhs yeah that it is so wild to think that we just stream everything now i think i think one thing that is that shocks me honestly in my daily life is just the thought that i am like yeah in in my lifetime technology has changed so drastically and i mean i am used to it because like i have grown up with it but i can not imagine if like you know for older generations who experienced technology at a certain pace and for example were using like payphones and and you know all those kinds of things for a while and then next thing you know you have mobile phones they have smartphones and you know that sort of progression but in such a sort short space of time yeah yeah i know i know because i remember being in like the 6th grade and maybe not it was maybe not in the 6th grade but like in elementary school and i was watching tv and they were talking about smartphones for the 1st time and like how smartphones will be released in korea the next year or something and i was actually kind of skeptical like i thought like 0 you know it is not going to like take on i guess but then wow it really did and yeah like i mean yeah i mean i guess when i was in elementary school you could still technically access the internet from your phone but it was like super super slow and super complicated and expensive to do that and you could like you could not like google things right you could just i do not know download songs or something but then like in the span of like 23 years we got proper smartphones and yeah i i remember when like it was difficult to watch youtube videos on smartphones because the downloading not not the downloading but like the loading speed was so slow you could not even watch it at like a 144 p but now honestly i remember that yeah but now the technology is so advanced like you can easily do like what 1080 p and yeah honestly like back in the day when you actually had to wait for the video to buffer now i do not remember the last time i saw the buffering sign on any streaming site 0 yeah 0 no i forgot i forgot all about that buffering si sign like the round thing like going around you know honestly maybe wait was that not the symbol you saw but like yeah yeah the little circular yeah rotating circular thing icon yeah because yeah i remember that because i remember watching wait so this was the time when i did not have a smartphone but my mom did so i was watching the annoying orange video do you know that channel it was annoying i was watching the annoying orange video on my mom is phone but like it would not load so i was like really frustrated and that that is a distinct memory i have that is so specific and honestly that is so cute i can just imagine mini you trying to trying to get the annoying orange to load honestly i swear when we were kids we used to worry about the wildest the wildest thing because i was literally saying to my parents the other day how i remember when i was younger and i used to read a lot of book series so because of that let us say i finish book 2 in a series or something and then now i need to try and find the next book  so i would check to see if it was in my local library check to see if it was in my school library  i would practically like search like high low up or down everywhere humanly possible for this book but then sometimes right i know that you know people would be borrowing it so the library does not have it so then i need to like special request my parents i would be like please can i have some money to buy this book practically every book collection ever apart from some that like maybe i would get a book set gifted to me i would just have random like books not in the chronological order so maybe i have  books 14 and 7 because because those are the ones i had to buy because the library did not have them okay 0 man good times yeah good days yeah i i remember going to a library a lot like as a kid too like my school library actually had a lot of really good books that i enjoyed reading and i i wish like the library at our university was a little more like that because i think they only sort of stock the more scholarly books and not for fun books 0 i get what you mean to be honest i have not really explored the library all that much like it was only the other day that i decided to start having a look cuz i figured as much as we we do probably mostly have academicy type stuff i was thinking that i just want to have some more like leisurely reading type type things that they i do not i do not know like last time i checked they do not they did not even have harry potter there what maybe no maybe some of the books are not in that library but potentially in another library in the sense that i think some of the as in even if the main library does not have everything  i think some of the other ones have books there that are not yeah yeah maybe if that makes sense yeah maybe i wonder if every anybody like actually uses the physical books out the library cuz i honestly never do cuz like when i use the library services it is to like access online resources right like scans of textbooks rather than 0 really  i mean i am kind of the same like i say that like i am bored but i mean i have not but i also used to think that hardly anyone borrowed stuff but i mean i have seen people borrow things and  i mean i guess maybe it depends on the degree as well yeah yeah some of these degrees need you to have the physical copy more than others so yeah yeah and i guess like if you are going to read a book from like cover to cover it is a lot better if you have a physical copy because honestly like in my courses i usually just need like one or 2 pages in the middle and never the whole book yeah that is true but that is but i guess there are degrees that require the entire thing yeah yeah that has been my experience as well cuz sometimes i just find it hard to read an e book like you said yeah yeah it just sometimes feels easier when you have the actual book in your hand yeah yeah that is i mean that is definitely true like yeah i mean just the experience is not the same honestly so wait what were what was i going to say so like you your exams are over right or do you have do you have other one tomorrow no i am finished thankfully 0 great but yeah so i i guess yeah that is that is 3rd year officially over yeah 0 my god it was such a whirlwind honestly it it is been it has been such a long year yeah but also i think i think we are pretty much done now okay great i am going to stop the recording now are you sure you want to stop recording to cloud yes (EDACC-C03-00)

some poor little post graduate students yeah working on their thesis 0 yeah so so when you were a kid what kind of games what kinds of games did you did you used to play is there one you remember well i think the 1st game i played on a on a htc phone i remember htc phone it is temple run temple run 0 yeah right everyone played it yes it is very popular here it is $3 on the phone i remember that so everyone were like just yes yeah so everyone just see it on their phone and start playing it yeah every time i went to the apple store 0 i would play games on their phone yeah i remember the plants vs zombies it is something that plants vs zombies yeah it is something that everyone played once yeah i still have it on my computer now 0 right 0 i have my mother played my mother was was even more than me you know she finished all the all the stages 0 stages some of my classmates in high school they even played when they were really yeah they played on class 0 last year when i was in high school after the 11 exams i played that game with my friends 0 on my xbox it is classic yeah i also watched some of the videos on bilibili ah about those games and modifications ones modifications yeah so it is like different versions of it like they also changed the game by theirselves 0 changed the game by theirself 0 so they can like play some subgames i do not know that was a by some some creator implemented inside the the game yeah 0 i know how they say it it sounds cool awesome i think the 1st time i played this game was in primary school when my uncle came to my grandpa is house ah he showed me how to play the game ah i do not remember when when i 1st played this game i just think it is like preinstalled on my ipad and i got my ipad like also in my also while i was in my primary school it is like 67 years old   that is grade one i think everyone loves it yeah also minecraft 0 minecraft minecraft every time i went to my visit my friends yeah and classmates we always play it together ah that is very interesting yeah but i do not while i was playing it i do not have friends play with me and when some of my friends start playing it i just do not play it anymore so which kind of mode do you prefer the survival one i think or the creative one i think the creative one 0 the other one same for me because i always get scared by those those zombies before yeah zombies lots of different and scary creatures 0 yeah 0 yeah by using creative mode you can build houses you can build different kind of building yeah there are many videos on bilibili and youtube as well 0 yeah yeah i have watched them they help you build houses yeah kind of using those different kind of decorations 0 yeah i think i watched someone that used the minecraft to build a computer i mean they build 0 from some like something like the from a very simple circuit how do they even how is that even possible i do not know maybe they are just very familiar with the computer very familiar with some guides some computer guides  the basic logic behind it and they just yeah it must be very hard and the part it is a i think it is an undergraduate student and he published a paper based on this 0 that is interesting and tricky yeah let me think about other games other games some small games 4399 4399 yeah so it is a chinese website that has many small games yeah similar games on it and yeah but i can not give it it is difficult for me to describe any of them the fireboy and watergirl 0 yeah they were at the so you just use the keystrokes to control the fireboy or watergirl and yeah roughly yeah yes together to accomplish some tasks i remembered when i was 6 years old i live in my grandma is house and we  played together ah the the 1st time i played this is while i visit my friend and she showed me the 4399 website i find this very interesting and the 1st thing we played together is the fire fire what fireboy and watergirl watergirl yeah yeah sometimes like in the computer class in primary school people would 0 just playing games under the nose of teachers yeah but our systems has the detection you know 0 the kind of things you do we will review on the computer ah that is sad yes we can only play games after we have done all the homework 0 is after all you can play after you have done your work you can play   so  did you play a sport or have another hobby when you are young 0 i played did i play a sport i i learned to dance from like the 1st year of my primary school 0 to the like to the 4th or 5th year and then i never dance anymore 0 because of the maybe because of the pressure pressure 0 yeah yeah of just studying and learning and preparing for exams and everything about the hobbies like yeah then hobbies i do you have any do you did you play a sport or have any other hobby as a kid i think the 1st hobby for me is playing piano piano  actually i have learned piano when i was in when i was in the kinder kindergarten yeah 0 and i only learned piano in kindergarten after i graduated from when i say graduate i feel i graduated from the kindergarten i just give up everything 0 i have not touched it anymore in kindergarten i think we play what is that called the slides the slides yes the slides you mean the the powerpoint slides no no the slides you are just sliding from the top then to the ground sliding from 0 i am sorry sorry for misinterpreting at least i a long time after school my parents found found me on the slides ah that could be interesting and we also have same class during primary school and kindergarten 0 that is good same class la la la la and i only played the piano for 3 years yes only 3 years 0 i think you have done a really great job on it i re i forgot everything  i played the piano for 2 years and i i just forgot everything but my sister  well not my sister my cousin  she did a very great job on piano ah she got a grade 7 certificate on piano wow that is impressive but she did not like studying at school she wants to go to music school instead 0 but her parents did not want that so it is very sad yeah that is very sad and now she did not get into a university i do not know how 0 did she she have planned for her future i do not know either my brother started learning playing the guitar during university 0 my high school classmate and i do think living in switzerland is too boring my classmate in high school also played guitar but not so good but still something i actually bought a guitar 0 for the past 2 years i played them randomly when i want ah that is nice yeah but it is but my finger always gets hurt ah a and yes do you bring the your guitar to uk no ah i i know someone here that bought a a bought a guitar a new guitar after arriving in the uk ah right okay gets a guitar ah he gave it to another senior classmate by the time he planned to leave edinburg ah but then he returned yeah  did you play did you play any sports during primary or secondary school no i just prepare for exams prepare for exams for exams the exams the pe exam the pe exam after the preparation i played basketball 0 yeah i just just played for the exam i do not seriously playing it for fun seriously play i just just play with other players as a team no never yeah i just the exam content i just keep practicing it practicing and i choose do you i chose volleyball as my 0 yeah yeah do do you play any during primary school i always go went swimming  during the summer really but then i rarely go to the stadium we have commonwealth through there the pool i in the school s stadium i think is always good is also good ah  do you plan to go there one day maybe next month next month  next month oof i am registering for a membership card 0 yeah that is great it is £22 per month 22 yes £2222 per month what else i can get from £22 maybe like 2 meals  i am still thinking about it yeah because if i plan to go to visit other places then it is not worth the money yeah  budget statement yes but my but my parents strongly suggest me to go to the gym ah ah why to build up my body strength ah stay healthy yeah because we just stay at home every day because of that maybe yes  i think walking on on the road is less effective than doing workout in the gyms of of course yeah but i prefer working i prefer working out a as well yes same i think work workout in the gym is torture yes i have not been to gym but i can imagine it i remember when i was in grade grade 11 or grade 10 yeah i went to the local gym near to my home huh and my mother bought the kind of course  which is one to one course  and the teacher is very strict to me  every time i went there 1st i will do one hour non oxygen workout no oxygen yeah i know i can get yes and then for another half an hour running or climbing exercise yeah and i and i got back home i was just lying on the bed and can not do nothing yeah it sounds but it is really effective i can not make it after 2 weeks or a month  i kind of lose weight around 4 to 5 kilograms wow yeah that is really effective and also my teacher forced me to eat less ah and every meal i should take a photo for her and send to her 0 god it is so scary yes  are you planning to go to other place no i mean not not these these days ah maybe june or july no i do not have any plan yet do you want to go to birmingham i dunno i just i want to just reduce my spending well i think the cost go to here is much less than london i know i know i get it but the trail the train the train still cost a lot 0 yes yeah maybe we should go to other place which is near edinburgh ah yeah then we can go there by bus that sounds a little is that possible it is a little time consuming i know it is time consuming but it saves money money and time  a trade off i think we can go to glasgow by bus you have been to glasgow yes but i it is about 6 months ago 6 months ago and do you want to go there again do you want to visit there again do you find glasgow interesting yes the university is very beautiful the university yes and the last time i went went there and the gallery is closed ah so it is worth visiting again ah yeah perfect   i was going to to the blackpool i am thinking about it but i do not have such interesting in the amusement park yeah i do not have such interest in interest in that yeah  so do you want to go to the park  amusement park yes i really want you really want to yes cause my cause my brother came this june 0 so he want to go now no no he does not want he does not want he does plan to visit london ah he will visit and london then you

check how many minutes are recorded yet ah yeah so what is your favorite thing about edinburgh my favorite thing about edinburgh edinburgh university no i dunno maybe the environment  like i can see the arthur is seat just from my window yes it is very good  like nature and the you can climb mountains you can just you you can go to the visit go to the seaside the the i i mean the enjoy the scenery yeah i think my favorite thing about edinburgh is the people around here ah it is much safer than living in london or other place in you mean that yes we can go out later at night and i feel safe to walk at to walk alone at night yeah people here are friendly much fri friendly much friendly is there a particular food you used to eat at you used to like a a child do you know how to make it do you still like eating it now i think it must be tomato fried eggs yeah yes i also like it i like every chinese food right now i remember when i was in grade 8 i huh and i think it is around the mid autumn festival huh and our teacher assigned us a homework that we should learn how to cook our dish by ourselves ah and we all must record a video 0 and every time before we go to lunch our teacher will randomly choose a video and allow allow us to see all the classmates in and that was 4 months 0 so i think the conversation is now enough now good so we should stop recording yeah i think so

1st yeah you go 1st yeah okay when i was a kid i think one of the games i really loved to play was the ps yes playstation playstation should i was that it should be playstation 2 yeah yes i i played that a lot i still recall and no i still play i still play and my favorite game there is the pro evolution soccer that is ps ps and i still play that a lot but now i have changed i i sometimes play ea sports fifa and i also love to play the mortal combat and i these days i play c 0 d 2 but i really have time for games anymore like i did before so maybe highest i play games now is just one now i just have to i have a lot of work to do so when i i do come back from work i am always too tired to play games and things like that but a few years ago i was really a game freak and i still play i still play and i like last week i played and i still i am very sure i still know how to play what about you yeah for me i think when i was a kid the one i remember very well was football yeah i played a lot of football when i was a kid you know when coming back from school i would not want to do anything else all i wanted to do was to play football and then have some fun with my kid it is originally football i usually played at that time so i can not really think of any game th then because i i was so i was so in love with the game i liked football as a game up to the point that i had to you know turn my my stockings my socks to football i had to you know turn my some of my exercise books and i will wrap them with a tape yeah and then kick them with my friends and some anything that looks like ball that worth you know kicking so yeah i it is football i loved to playing then and now i do not think i still play football i really do not have much time for football because all i want to do now is you know just yeah i am trying to survive i am struggling to survive you know so i need some money so i think i have been working working working working working i do not really have much time for football not like i do not like football i still do but i think i do not really have much time to play football yeah hm about playing football before i came to scotland i was i was a gu a kind of i i i always wanted to be a professional footballer yeah but things changed now because growing up in a place where you you do not get to you there are 1000s of people playing football and only a few are getting a become a a are getting or are earning from it like it was really really i felt really really downcasted when i realized that i could not make money from football and i had to just stop playing football and go play and go go for my dreams like s go to school and things like that i sometimes it gets me pissed off but i am okay with it i still watch a lot of football and still play football but it i do not want to take it as a profession anymore i just want to enjoy myself and just see how i can just put everything put everything in place and get to understand how life is going to be from now yeah yeah sure and same happened with me here because while growing up i think a lot of people wanted to be in wanted to be a professional footballer you know played for chelsea arsenal and all of that but as we grew things began to change in our lives and then we began to see ourselves in you know in various places working for money and i would just the you know like the interest for the interested if people just disappeared like that but no some people still have the you know the time like i said i do not much i do not have that much time to to play football and i still watch football yeah okay so like apart from just watching football are you a fan of any team do you support any team no no no i do not support any team so you just watch football casually yeah i just watch football actually i love ma lately i would just watch i love man u i love to watch manchester united and i think they are the best team in the world so maybe since you do not have a team you are supporting you should just come and support manchester united i wish ah i wish though so you do not want to watch you do not want to support manchester united you should maybe one day we should just go watch not like i do not want to support man what do you think no more like one day not like i do not want to support man u yeah they are doing well yeah they are doing perfectly well but right now i do not think i have that time to you know what i am really scared about football is that you know when you go watch football and when you come back you have to face some banters with your friends or yeah with your your your opponents maybe people yeah people that are not your like man u played and like the last team the other day man u and one team played like that and then i had to come back to the house i did not watch the ball i i went out i had to come back and i met some of my neighbors arguing arguing arguing a lot about football so i do not that is one thing i would not want to find any club because of the banters we would have to face with your your your opponents i understand i perfectly understand isha yeah but i do play football games too you nah i am such a boring person all i do is work for money so holidays i do work for money too i i work double shifts sometimes because i i have to go work for my educational bills too so you you are not the only person working but i just try to make them out for every other thing yeah but i do not really see myself playing video ga video games yeah you watch movies yeah sometimes i do sometimes i do but not regularly you know maybe when i am just hanging out with friends we go see a movie with popcorn a and then we come back to the house so but you see now i am not allowed to watch a movie i think i i find it i find that very difficult unless i go out with a friends then that is when i can watch a movie okay how about you i watch a lot of movies and i i prefer most times i like when i am watching series yeah because i li i i like the suspense that comes with it so i watch a lot of series my favorite my favorite series peaky blinders if you have you seen peaky blinders can you hear me can you hear me yeah i can hear you okay i was saying have you ha have you seen peaky blinders peaky blinders is is a very nice series it is something it is a movie that you would like to watch and you would like it yeah peaky blinders i have heard a lot about the movie for and i think it would be an interesting movie but i will just have to see it one day i hope so and also i love game of thrones too that was i think that was my favorite one until i actually watched peaky blinders okay that is great i think i have seen game of thrones i have not all the episodes you know and not all the season because there was a time they stopped and i think that was when i stopped watching game of thrones that was was it almost the last episode yeah so they had to delay they had to delay the the last was it the last season or episode yeah and that and i stopped watching game of thrones okay i actually watched the i i i think i i watched the last episode where one of the dragons died and tsk it was it was actually very i felt i felt very very should i say sad about it and things like that but tsk you know movies there are there are there are things that you should try and just understand that it to be a movie it is never going to end the way you want it to yeah sure yeah i think too i i do not think there is anything else we are supposed to talk about ah it is almost it is 15 minutes we started this meeting and i think it is 15 minutes now right okay yeah yeah yeah sure okay so i think i should end it i do not know have a nice time bro thank you for having me so i will just stop the

thinks my brain is or maybe because i live in island tropical island my brain will be super slow so it will be fine okay well i mean one of the things is they said do not do anything like super

complains then boom  yeah who was going to start a like a bicycle like raman touring company or something so maybe i can make him he is not actually going to do it but i am more like i could be like can you like make make an excuse or something but probably i will be like yeah yeah it is totally my friend is ramen touring company small hm yeah i mean he is still he is still working doing his normal job but right but some of my co workers started their own business during covid  and some are leaving our company to focus on their business  one guy say it is about what is it spg environmental stuff  yeah so so that also makes me seem like what i have been doing you know some people are starting their own job but i am just chilling on a tropical island windsurfing drinking whiskey sounds like fun life yeah yeah i was going to be like i was like 0 maybe not that bad yeah yeah yeah definitely and like just starting a like environmental company from from an island kind of makes sense  someways depends on what he is doing maybe i should  yeah i have no idea but yeah the windsurfing has been fun i started to sail faster now it gets me it makes me so scared  when i go you know but it is fun i i feel improvement every day so i can not wait to do it with you ne have you done it once on on a because it is so lake in scottland frustrating to get better  you know you can not just you know get on and done it takes time because you have to move kind of opposite of what you do on land  so yeah so you can not really enjoy the day you started  so it sucks yeah i enjoyed it the day i started it but i also that is good me too no you know like i want you to go yeah yeah yeah for sure i mean i definitely enjoy something if it is mostly me like falling over and going sploosh and getting back up again so and our water is so clear so even you fall you do not feel like icky or anything like it is actually fine and you see lots of fish so 0 sounds so beautiful i am looking forward to seeing you in miyako great okay i am going to stop the recording okay (EDACC-C14-00)
hi my participant number is c 15 p one i am just going to read the paragraph please call stella ask her to bring these things with her from the store 6 spoons of fresh snow peas 5 thick slabs of blue cheese and maybe a snack for her brother bob we also need a plastic snake and a big toy for toy frog for the kids she can scoop these things into 3 red bags and we will go meet her wednesday at that train station hi my participant number is c 15 p 2 and it is my turn to read the paragraph please call stella ask her to bring these things with her from the store 6 spoons of fresh snow peas 5 thick slabs of blue cheese and maybe a snack for her brother bob we also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids she can scoop these things into 3 red bags and we will go meet her wednesday at that train station we we do have a conversation now yeah okay so what are we talking about yeah so the topic that we have chosen was basically what was the 1st movie that we watched that was based on a book so for me it is alice in wonderland what was it for you for me i think it is harry potter like 1st the 1st one yeah the 1st one i mean i remember reading philosopher is 0 sorcerer is stone and then i watched the movie like my sister told me that there are movies on these books  and then i watched it and it was amusing the 1st one was a really nice one true what was your favorite have you seen all the 7 harry potter movies or 0 wait yes yes yes i am a pureblood sure you are what is what what is your favorite one out of all of those i think the 1st one because so the 1st one was like the exact like the most appropriate representation of what i had thought  what i had imagined from the book  so the 1st one was the most appropriate one for me that makes sense and that is just yeah and it was also like i do not know it was nice and good like like ver very similar to what she wrote at least like jk rowling wrote yeah exactly that makes sense what about you how did you feel after watching alice in wonderland hey it was alice in wonderland was an animation movie of course so it was interesting of course but i obviously preferred the books i actually preferred the sequel to alice in wonderland called through the looking glass much more than 0 yes i remember their poem jabberwocky twas brillig and the slithy toves yeah and then gimble in the wabe i forgot it is a nonsense poem yeah because it is it is hung have you watched hunger games have i watched hunger games i have watched the 1st movie that that is the have you read hunger games yeah i have read hunger games of course i have read hunger games  the hunger games honestly i think okay like i this is going to be a spoiler filled conversation i feel but the ending of hunger games do you remember it or not yeah i have read it i have watched it yeah right so it is so realistic right yeah that is exactly what happens and that is why i hate it so much the my favorite part of hunger games was like katniss the dresses that she wore 0 right cinna yeah yeah cinna those creations so every time like and the representation of it in movies also was so amazing like i realized she would open some dress and she would turn into mockingjay or something yeah that is true i mean i think that is the the 2 dresses right the 1st is one where she is on fire cause like she is yeah yeah and then other one is the one where she turns into the mockingjay right yeah and there is another one when they are re when they are called again for the games  when all that when sh when they say that is she is pregnant she comes as a bride 0 she 0 i i have not seen that part so i do not remember 0 so there is this like every her dresses always for me i do not know her dress dress speaks way more than anything else that is happening there yeah like it is a it is a story of its own fair enough i get it i mean that is what they wanted to show in the books also right like that was yeah the plotline with cinna that he used the like he used fashion to bring up and it is just actually interesting to think about considering like throughout at least the 1st book they really keep describing the capitol is fashion and how outrageous it is exactly exactly just cinna using it to you know create to like display katniss personality in such a like it is a so her like he literally just turns it on its head turns the trope on its head like the outrageous fashion and it is like suddenly becomes what do you call it like like a symbol exactly it becomes a symbol and like expression because you can not  really say anything against the capitol out loud  you can not stand against the capitol yeah and so like this is very subtly rebelling against the capitol  which was extremely amazing that is true actually like i i feel like for i mean it was pretty brilliant how if you look at it for for like the people of the capitol that was just another kind of outrageous fashion for at least the yeah capitol people they were like 0 wow look at this new designer like new york fashion type feelings yeah but for the people in power like president snow and all these people yeah yeah yeah he knew what it meant and and this is also why they basically killed cinna like yeah which is why they killed cinna yeah like even the reporter who used to like host the whole event of the games effie effie trinket 0 yeah i cannot remember his name her name huh so even the host was very i do not know how to say like she knew what questions to ask true she knew what questions to ask and how to get information like yeah whenever katniss used to show up and she used to you know wear some like like some dress and something  he used to call her out that she used to point that she used to bring attention to that yeah like you know this is the message i like the effie trinket is character to be honest well i liked hunger games a lot like it was a very  good book and movie yeah like it was one of the dystopian books done right even though yeah the thing is like again like back to the ending it was it is not like it was the perfect ending it was a brilliant ending yeah true true it was just that it was so goddamn realistic that i did not like it okay were you because team 0 go ahead 0 no i was just saying okay this is the problem like you usually fall into like these kind of books to you know the hero comes out on top at the end of the yeah yeah yeah they win everything and they live happily ever after and bullshit and then this this like woman just comes in and just literally pulls the rug out from under her feet going 0 by you know by the way the real look is like this i am like i do not want to know were you teams peeta or team gale was it team gale the love the the love interest yeah yeah gale i think i am team peeta yeah same like i i completely understand the whole what do you call it you in the last book not the whole thing with like which one will you choose and like yeah the reasoning is solid man honestly like seriously i do not like katniss does not need someone who adds fire to her fire she already has all of that yeah like ticking time bomb exactly i mean the concept of yin yang opposites attract yeah they someone who can calm you down exactly yeah peeta is like the water to her fire she does not need does not need oil to be added to her flames yeah by the way teams remind me like which team were you on twilight eh why why would you bring that up i know no none of them i do not know why i suddenly remembered absolutely none of them no team edward or team jacob neither  freaking what no i please no we are not i was team taylor lautner 0 my god that is just shirtless taylor lautner that is horrifying i do not want to talk about twilight please like it has been okay it has been more than 15 years now i but yeah anyway what how did we even end up at twi 0 yeah because of the teams eh let us move on to like  what what else i like thinking back to harry potter you said you liked the 1st movie i would actually say i i liked the 3rd one the best like i find that 0 a lot of people choose prisoner yeah of azkaban yeah i feel like that was the more like the closest to like i mean the 1st one was obviously very close but i feel like the 3rd one captured the what is it called the aura the environment  the i i do not know just it it really captured the essence of the  book really well that is probably just because alfonso cuaron but yes because that guy is brilliant but in general that was the one that i really liked and then i do not know it just went downhill no i really liked the 5th one the 5th one was really nice with like because also because like i really like luna lovegood she is one of my favorite 0 characters huh and the 5th was the one like it was also one of the saddest books but also the happiest because everybody was there like there was remus there was sirius there was luna  fred  george everyone like the whole order of phoenix yeah it was like the one happy moment before everything went to shit exactly the calm before the storm the calm before the storm that makes sense i did not actually yeah enjoy the 5th one that much to be honest i do not know why though i think it was just because by that time i had stopped really liking the actors also ah maybe makes sense i feel yeah i did not like prisoner of azkaban at all really yeah i do not know like the chamber of secrets is my most hated one yeah i do not like chamber of secrets myself and then prisoner of azkaban or also goblet of fire also what goblet goblet of fire yeah in goblet of fire so i was so annoyed at the fact that they like goblet of fire was probably one of my favorite books out of the series same same what i was going to say yeah i think it was because of the whole triwizard tournament the challenges exactly and the new schools and new yeah yeah yeah characters like knowing that there are other yeah magic magic schools yeah exactly like all of that and then what is it called ah and then the fact that they just removed everything from the maze like i loved the whole maze 0 yes of the triwizard tournament and yeah removed all the cool things like the sphinx and everything from the maze and they yeah this weird i do not know american deep south body horror yeah also like the whole meme about harry did you put your name in the goblet of fire 0 my god dumbledore asked calmly exactly dumbledore asked calmly like in the movie flies across the room shakes harry and he is like did you 0 relax another thing that i will never this much emotion forget in these ah movies is that they put the whole blame on shawshanks for like for telling umbridge all the yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah was not it the  other one the ma marietta yeah it was shawshanks then some edgecombe something something something yes  but obviously they they do not show half of the characters and so yeah also they tried to the whole get rid of shawshanks so that ginny would come in as the love interest exactly in the book ginny is so cool man 0 exactly in the book ginny is so cool but in the movies they just shown her as some idiot yeah dumb person yeah i do not like movie ginny at all like the book ginny was so it is a watered down version of the book ginny  huh book ginny was amazing like yeah yeah yeah yeah she she was good at quidditch she was yeah she knew how to tackle all her 7 brothers yeah right like she was good at bat bogey hexes exactly she was good at that good at hexes and then she yeah i i felt i do not know like after so i mean like now i am talking about harry potter like this but generally after this whole debacle with like jk rowling i just  do not have the same sense of connection with harry potter anymore i do not know because they for me yes as a person maybe jk rowling  is bad or whatever her books are different like true of the author is you are a very very bad person but okay no seriously i mean books are completely different they have got nothing to do with with jk rowling other than the fact that she wrote it  it is sep it is separate from her fair enough but yeah i mean i do not think like i have the capacity to completely differentiate the art from the artist so 0 lose interest in things like in art when the artist yeah good person so that and also because of course like my favorite what do you call it my favorite book has always been lord of the rings so ah like you really what was the 1st series you have read the 1st series i have read a lot actually but maybe maybe narnia i think the chronicles of narnia probably it was your 1st i am not sure like the the that was the one that i remember because i read c s lewis when i was really young like i was 9 exactly or so i think so yeah i am i am sure i would have probably read other stuff before like i read a lot of you know the famous 5 secret 7 0 yes yes like that all that but nancy drew nancy drew hardy boys but when i read  series 0 you remember the enid blyton the school well school series malory tower saint clare 0 yes yes yes yes yes yes yeah yes that i feel like if i if you want to call it like series if you want to know then i would say that those were the ones that i read 6th no mine was eragon the ah the fire dragon eragon yeah yeah yeah 0 eragon i i read that actually really like surprisingly i read eragon really late like when i was even percy jackson for example like these are the books that you are  reading in like your preteens right but yeah then i had never like nobody like had ever given these to me when i was at that age yes and so i ended up reading them at like 1718 and i did not like them at all 0 eragon specifically because it was very similar to lord i mean paolini christopher paolini himself said that he yeah inspirations from the lord of the rings yeah and so because i had read the lord of the rings 1st then eragon just seemed like this watered down copy and i was like okay i did not enjoy that that much ah same with percy jackson like i think just because i had crossed the age for exactly yeah i did not enjoy it was not it the same for you no i read i started with eragon and i read it in 5th like when i was in 5th standard  and then i then i started harry potter then hunger games then the divergent series and like then twilight 0 it was a back to back series that makes sense yeah but actually i am pretty much same like when these ones were anyway coming out when we were like 1516 right yes i when i read harry potter i was 11 like i started harry potter when i was harry potter 11 and by the time ah i finished it like yeah because it was difficult to arrange books at that time i could not find all the books at once huh so like i had to give gaps even though i did not really want to 0 that makes sense but i still had to wait because it was difficult to find books and then ah but also harry potter which is why i was a hardcore potterhead because ah i read it around the same age ah 0 when it was written and so i was all like you know houses and i remember reading the read the like i the good thing with me was that we had all the like my mother used to handle the books in the school library right like she would 0 and so i could just like put in 0 by the way yeah this is the book i want to read just so i read through all the 7 books like i started at like when i was 10 i think  and then the last like book 7 came when i was in class 7 that is when i was 13 ah so i read book 7 then only i see now once i read that i moved onto of course like the other series like like hunger games and yeah and the well some of you you had like divergent these are all the apocalypse yeah yeah at that point of time it was yes so funny thinking it was huh what there were these phases for me like 1st there was this apocalypse and dystopian future and stuff  then there were like books based on cancer and  you know trauma ptsd  so i had like kite runner and 0 yeah back to back like i have not read yeah you know that right you have not read i i tried okay i tried like okay so basically the thing what happened was okay i will not say i have not read it but basically what happened was i was in what ninth 10th i do not know the ninth i think and all these people were you know after well maybe 11th i do not even know but i was yeah at 11th because i remember i had like exams or something i was not reading and i do not think yeah so maybe okay anyway so if i was in 11th i would have been like 16 or som 17 and these people were like yo you will read it read it you will cry so much you will cry so much and i kept waiting for the time that i would cry and i was like i the book ended and i was like where am i supposed to cry same i do not know it was too i i i i have no idea like too cheesy for me the book and even the movie was too huh and i mean i do not know it it felt fake for some reason i have true no other words to explain it it just felt fake as if someone was trying too hard to make it you emotional about cancer yeah it is like it was it was basically like nicholas sparks on like crack 0 yes but i think we should also like one stop chatting in like 0 yes this call 40 minutes about it  anyway go ahead finish with your thought yeah i was saying that a book that actually did make me cry a lot a lot was ps i love you 0 wow my god i was a kid okay i was in 5th standard when i read it why would you do that to yourself but okay i do not know i will i will reserve judgment on this then because you were young okay right okay thank you bye thanks bye bye (EDACC-C09-00)
okay so i think we are recording my participant number is c 25 p one and please call stella ask her to bring these things from her with her from the store 6 spoons of fresh snow peas 5 thick slabs of blue cheese and maybe a snack for her brother bob we also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids she can scoop these things into 3 red bags and we will go meet her wednesday at the train station perfect okay my participant number is c 25 p 2 and please call stella ask her to bring these things from with her from the store 6 spoons of fresh snow peas 5 thick slabs of blue cheese and maybe a snake for her brother bob we also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids so can she can scoop these things into 3 red bags and we will go meet her wednesday at the train station yeah okay nice all right i will start the timer for our conversation i think we will be talking about formula one right ah what a surprise i did not see i know that one coming no neither did i but what was the i mean the race was better than i expected actually like it was going to be so boring because it is spain always but honestly well it probably was not the best so far of this season but it was not like boring like i were not i was not bored no no actually i think so and it was also nice that they had some more tire changes than normally normally it is yes just one tire change and then nothing really happens and then whole middle sector is pretty boring and then in the end you know that actually it will be it ends as you want it to but things things happened yes it was good  leclerc got broken down i was very happy for a 2nd so my dutch guy could win was it 0 wait hamilton or leclerc leclerc was in 1st and then he what happened again with him i think something with the power units i watched like the replay it seemed that the gearbox or something just started no no sorry the turbo the turbo yes you had like the the turbo we had 0 could hear the wind spinning and then all of a sudden like it cut out and you could hear like metal like whistling or like whining it was like 0 0 poor guy that guy does not have luck with engines because also bahrain in 2019 right he was leading and then poof his engine 0 he was leading in monaco last year or he was going to start in 0 pole position and then his engine poof well no like last year he proved himself so he got pole position then max was dragged through get was actually putting in a fast lap and then leclerc got put himself in the wall started 1st because of the decision was ended and yeah then with with with hitting the wall and his tires he fucked up his gearbox i think yeah no well that is that is true but it was purely accidental i mean i remember when yeah nico rosberg did the same thing he like out and michael schumacher actually did the same thing very famously so i think schumacher was 1st in monaco where he like into the very you know the final cor like the 2nd to final corner where it casts like yeah yeah yeah the the yeah he he was also was like michael like it was in the 9 or early 2000s he was pole position it was the final lap like everyone was doing their final lap and he like just did not even bother turning it in like he just understeered into the wall but like you could see he was not even trying to do a lock and then in 2 thosand 14 or 15 i think nico rosberg he like outbraked himself into that into the breaking zone right before the hairpin and he like went you know he went into the runoff zone and yellow flag so no one could not prove their time and he just reversed out and he drove up to pole position and won but yeah no but poor leclerc i actually have hopes from this weekend i think he can put himself in 1st place again and then hopefully finish the race this time i do not think i do not think ferrari is suited man i mean because i have been hearing that mercedes is really well for slow corners mercedes is apparently one of the best teams and last on the spain they fixed their whole porpoising issues an hamilton was the fastest car on track like consistently so i have i do not like mercedes i do not li i think i have diagnosed myself i just support the underdog like i supported ferrari yeah through their entire shit phase where it was just an abomination and they still are because ferrari will always find a way to fuck i do not know if we can swear will always find a way sh will always find a way to mess up but yeah no i am hoping russell i think russell i am going to say yeah russell is going to out qualify and win if not max i do not think checo has got it no i do not think carlos has got it if carlos crashes out again honestly he is going to get sacked they just signed a contract extensions with him yeah yeah yeah but no well we will see but well i also i i just also really do not like hamilton so i think if russell wins i will be happy as well and i also yeah but i think it also will be nice since last year max he won the championship but i have to agree no no not really so i think it would be nice if he actually won fair in rio this year and then afterwards i will be happier with any of our guy to to win the championship except for hamilton i do not like still do not like hamilton no i do not want him to do i definitely do not want hamilton to beat schumacher is record i mean he already has most races in qual in pole positions but i do not want him to have more world championships no than michael also i just realized we are matching kind of shirts almost i good stuff and even your flag is matching the whole thing yeah for my scottish vibes everything in blue and white did you by it in scotland yeah yeah yeah i thought my walls here are very very empty there is nothing on it and yeah at some point i thought okay if i hang a flag there is a large space of my wall was covered that should be fine that is true and that my grandfather also sent me a picture because he also thought it was too empty so i now i have got my my sister ah i have actually did that is from the park like near waverley right and 0 yeah all the i have actually never been in that it think that is where the festival was that you guys wanted to go did you get the ticket for the flag open air no because you did not there was not there was not the things that they sold today because wanted to buy tickets 0 wait i do not think we that is i do not think we should add mention names no but one of friends wanted to buy tickets ah really and but so they started selling tickets at 100 clock in the morning and they were only at half an hour later they were all sold out already 0 what no so i mean no i think open air was the thing that our other friend went to yeah no i know i know i know and it was during the exams for you for the energy and slide scale 0 that weekend so we when i went there yesterday it is it it it is called prince gardens it is pretty pretty nice and it is less windy because that is where we were drinking right yeah yeah yeah yeah 0 was it less what less windy yeah because it is in between sort of 2 hills yeah in the meadows it was extremely windy and i did not really like it and then i i said to our friend that we friend do we really want to sit there so then we went to the prince garden because we could yeah because it is more sheltered there are more trees and less wind and it was actually it was really nice and we could still sit in the sun that is a good idea enjoy it yeah i i i i actually do not know if because i think meadows like no one is going to catch you but i do not think you are allowed to drink in public so there is were were you the only 2 drinking there or like were you guys the only ones drinking there or was everyone else there i do not know if you get a fine for it i also do not know 0 but i did not know but now i know but all good sorry i know during the fringe you can drink in outdoors 0 but i do not know around i know else in scotland like dundee or glasgow you will police finds it enjoyable to hand out fines for so it is like an activity for them like 0 this guy this guy yeah 0 well yeah so i yeah but i have to behave myself i do not want to get i need to 3 tore months of behaving myself here i do not want to get into trouble i do not want to be sent back no exactly when i am so close to finishing my degree so i will look out a bit but i think every time you cycle cycle past the men out there i always yeah they are sitting there and when we are in meadows there would not be enough police people to like you know contain everyone there you know yeah so so so 0 well it should be fine urgh but yeah 0 but yeah i am i am thinking thinking about it i did not actually realize that george became 3rd yeah yeah he he went he went from he f he that is the 2nd podium right yeah i also looked so apparently this is this was the 6th race spain i believe and he has not finished below 5th all of this time seriously yeah 0 then let us go russell every single one of his races he literally has he was a top top 5 or better and obviously like i do not think now mercedes would definitely be the 3rd strongest car especially with the upgrades from spain but still it means that russell was only outraced by either a ferrari or a red bull i am actually not sure if anyone else impressive yeah i do not know if you know i am also by the way looking at the practice times in 1st practice he put in the 4th 4th fastest time 2nd practice he put in the 2nd fastest time and 3rd practice he put in the 3rd fastest time he actually did quite well only then he yep 0 he was actually 4th after qualifying yeah i did not realize that he was doing so well yeah he is so consistent like ah i think hamilton is going to retire quickly before people start comparing them too much because or or move teams but so apparently like hamilton was always like 0 ferrari you know is a is a dream i would want to finish my career with ferrari but ferrari now s signed leclerc for i think another 3 or 4 years and sainz for also for at least until the end of 2026 so yeah like hamilton is not but sainz like there is a budget cap cause i was reading this like you know he helmut marko heard the guy the not the christian horner guy for red bull but this other old austrian dude who does like driver management 0 yeah yeah yeah yeah he was like trash talking to the media basically on ferrari saying like 0 i do not think we are spending more than ferrari we are definitely move into budgets cap and you know sainz crashing 33 or 4 times out of the last 3 races that can not be cheap to repair you know like you know while while we are developing the car and making upgrades you know ferrari is spending money on fixing the sainz is crashed car which honestly some of the accidents were pretty big but on the other hand i am not sure the 1st 3 race 2 or 3 races and checo and verstappen both from red bull their engine stopped because it was too hot yeah yeah yeah they can not be cheap either that is true yeah i mean did ferrari get a 12 that day i am checking them out yes they got a 12 there was a ferrari 12 on the opening race of the season that is kind of cool yeah so yeah i am not sure how how they will fix the that stuff but i also remember on the 1st race it was all red bull engines also the alf the alphatauri yeah engines who broke down yeah yeah it was just one so i am looking now at the results so i think actually norris was on the podium once as well this season lando yeah in imola 0 imola it was was that a re re 0 yeah that was the race where they did not want to turn on rs for like ha half the lap 0 my 0 yeah yeah that was the most boring race of this i think of this season yeah no there was indeed nothing happening there that was terrible yep and miami was miami interesting miami was quite good i mean it was not that well like you enjoyed there were some overtakes spain was good spain was a decent race spain was really good yeah how was australia was australia any good i am trying to remember yeah it was the one that was in the middle of the night so i did not watch it 0 yeah 0 yeah yeah yeah but i did yeah well i watched it but i swear there was nothing that happened nice yeah i mean russell podiumed which is nice nice and lewis in 4th look at that ah nice nice nice outperformed by yeah by a rookie ah he is not such a 0 my god see i feel bad okay at least now it is but had spent like 3 to 4 seasons it must have been at least 3 seasons in a williams so yeah but okay let us see let us see the standings i am curious of the overall standings i will see how how long we have been talking for by the way 0 wow we are actually almost at 13 minutes good good good okay so who is going to win the championship after the 1st 6 races now that knowing what you know who is going to win yeah i i think wait i need to f find the overall driver stands i think 1st the overall driver yeah yeah stands then we will make a good informed decision  but 0 this is just old okay wait standings season 2021 22 2022 i am sorry yeah why can not i see everything and just spain hold on a sec i am going to send it to you 0 and google has it for me right i think if i just google it then the 0 google have it as well yeah driver standing i got it okay next is max in front yeah with 6 pints woo you have to go with netherlands but i think ah to be honest i think ferrari should win this no but if they continue doing it like going like this then max will take it and i still i still want to say i hope max will will actually win where he deserves to win instead of what happened last year yeah yeah and i do think there is a good chance that actually will happen so i am rooting for this is what i am rooting for and what i am hoping for no okay it is ma okay ma okay so he is now leading honestly ferrari being ferrari i just they got lucky with the you know the development phase but i do not think they have the resources and the and the intellect the the brains in the team to actually like keep developing the car and make smart upgrades like i have just been so pessimistic of ferrari like they ruined fernando alonso is career they ruined vettel is career they are going to ruin charles leclerc is and sergio perez is career it is just what they do so yeah i do not know i am going to say i am going to say verstappen is going to win it i think quite easily but for the teams i think red bull might but it is going to be close with mercedes i think ferrari is going to drop 3rd yeah i think i think red bull should win that as well but sport yeah i do not know i would say i also would be happy with mercedes yep being 2nd but now and i think i i s somewhat i also somewhat like the classic ferrari car the red one the the the the beautiful horse so i think it is always always nice to see them perform well and i hope they i hope they win the constructors and then after it would be nice but that is what i hope it is not that i think i think red bull will win the constructors mercedes will be 2nd ferrari will be 3rd and then max will win checo will not be in the top 3 i think no i do not think checo will be at all russell leclerc and and max will outclipse him but who knows well okay i think wait let me just check that we have been talking for long enough yeah we are 17 minutes with i think

train station hi my participant number is c 20 dash p 2 and i am going to read the passage please call stella ask her to bring these things with her from the store 6 spoons of fresh snow peas 5 thick slabs of blue cheese and maybe a snack for her brother bob we also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids she can scoop these things into 3 red bags and we will go meet her wednesday at the trains station all right so let us talk about food yeah food is a good topic is not it my favorite how what what was your favorite food growing up 0 my goodness well it is kind of difficult to answer because what with my brother is diet restrictions there was a 6 month period where i had spaghetti every day for dinner and not by choice it is traumatic i guess very traumatic despite this one of my favorite foods was still spaghetti with tomato sauce and cheese fair enough which speaks to the prevailing nature of pasta apart from that it is kind of hard to remember i really liked hummus which i feel like is quite sophisticated 0 but i really like yes just like on its own and stuff on bread and things that was very very nice and i liked i liked colin the caterpillar cake as well because it had very okay it had bits that were like a pure pure chocolate like a chocolate bar instead of like a cakey mix okay so that is more enjoying the choc chocolate of it than the actual cake yeah the other the only other thing was fairy bread have you heard of it no okay so it is sort of it is sort of okay do not judge me it is an australian thing and it is made from white bread with a layer of like margarine or butter and then sprinkles on top and okay yeah it tastes really really good and normally when i tell people that they say it is disgusting but i loved it as a kid yeah okay fair enough i mean i like i i loved sprinkles and i loved white bread so yes i can absolutely see that you can understand it and you need the butter to stick the sprinkles like that is how it works yes obviously i mean what did you like as a kid 0 i think something like well i mean pita obviously and all all kinds of white bread or white bread rolls or something like that i loved them so bread rolls fresh or yeah sort of from the bakery  or sort of pudding i really like pudding so what what sort of pudding more like okay right more more probably like a custard thing 0 i loved custard yes so custard made from sort of packet sort of sachet that you would then stir into milk and yeah that that was really good or yeah i was not a huge vegetable fan any kind of surprising considering how you are like now yeah i it it has changed a bit but yeah not terribly into cheese like sort of very plain very simple cheeses but but no cheese with too complex fl flavors could absolutely not stand courgettes  or aubergines hated them and yeah sort of did you did you eat any like weird foods as a kid  that you would not eat now that is or maybe you would eat it now i do not know i mean i i used to really like i guess here it is similar to black pudding sort of sort of sausage which is made with a or or with i think pig blood  so that is so so yeah it is probably similar to black pudding quite like that which seems probably quite strange what i also really liked was pumpkin that was sort of pumpkin in in jars so you would you would sweet style pumpkin that you would sort of boil  and then put put into jars and that i really liked that as well because it was sort of sweet sour like a did you like pickle it or is it preserved yeah in jars or is it just to hold it yeah okay pickled just sort of pickled exactly and i i was able to eat rice just like plain white rice preferably bas basmati rice just  just like that yeah and terribly bored of salads my parents loved salads so i did not like salads obviously and got really annoyed at with with plum jam at some point because we had loads and loads of plums and we had way too much plum jam and yeah yeah but yeah that that has all changed quite a bit how do you feel i know you are as averse now how how how has your how have your food habits changed and why have they changed i mean growing up with 2 brothers i just learned that you should eat everything presented to you and you should eat whatever the others do not eat as well because if that was the thing if my brother is did not finish a plate my dad and i would finish it so there was no food waste and if i put i think i have told you if if anything goes in the fridge i just expect it to be gone next time  we had like enough food in the house it is just that everybody was grabbing at it so i have always developed the the thing of older the that if you as i am older that like if you have extra rice in the pan it is a challenge to finish the rice you have committed to the rice you have to finish the rice so i guess i see meals as a bit of a challenge but also just food is fantastic i love it there are very few foods i i did not like as a kid and there are very few foods i do not like now like al almost everything i eat now i also ate as a kid i think the exceptions will be coffee although i did not really have that much as a kid but like more of a coffee flavor  and i think like brown brown seedy bread i did not i did not like seedy bread as a kid at all i hated the taste of sunflower seeds because i ate them too much we had sunflowers we took the seeds and then i just like i just overdid it but apart from that mostly the same thing i i did eat as a kid i ate a lot of ketchup on toast when i was at a baby sitters  and i probably would not eat that now i am not going to lie to you thinly spread so it was not too unhealthy but i i would not i think i think i would give that one pass but apart from that i do not think i have really changed i eat more vegetables now that is the only thing because i my parents bless them they they were very good cooks in any ways but they were not good at just preparing plain vegetables  because they would do that the thing the british thing of boiling them and now i am a bit older i know to steam them and then like very lightly season them and they taste much better 0 well that that is certainly a step forward yeah you live and you learn do not you yeah yeah i think like growing up it it was also a thing for for me i mean i am i am an only child and still it was a thing of sort of finishing food and it it being regarded as being good if you finished food and do you think that is something to do with the older generation like quite yeah that is that is possible like i i do not know it definitely came from my parents and also sort of everyone around around me being like 0 yes we will we will or it is it was it was not necessarily enforced that you would finish your food but  it it was suggested or also like wh when we would go to a restaurant or something like that you would you would try to eat up everything and i think that is actually not a good idea like no i think it is good to know your limits instead exactly exactly sort of because for example say pasta i can eat a lot of pasta very quickly and then i feel very very full afterwards because i have overeaten because i do not register quickly enough how how much i have eaten  and so yeah i i think that is that is actually not really a good idea yeah but otherwise i think like in terms of what i now eat is i think i am i am a bit more tolerant towards cheeses i can so and i think that is also a known thing that that children do not or that for example some bitter flavors are perceived much stronger by children than than by adults i have heard hat as well that their their taste systems are heightened  so when they prefer bland food they literally are are tasting in a different way to you that they are not just uninventive it just is strong for them yeah yeah exactly and so i think that has changed a bit but when when i am alone i basically do not eat cheese and also all right yeah i i tried to to eat far more vegetables and i cook a lot as opposed to eating a lot of bread when i am at home and i think that has more to do with sort of trying to eat as healthily as possible and also sort of being a bit more aware of what is what the actual calorie components of foods or calorie amounts in foods are or assuming that i know i am i am not quite like yeah anyway but i i think yeah that is that has massively changed  and and i always liked fish and yeah 0 going home it will be nice to have some fish again because when i am alone i usually do not prepare fish because it is kind of a hassle yeah i know what you mean and it makes no sense i think to prepare fish when you are actually with some other people and then you can sort of do it all you know in sort of almost in bulk yeah and then all the tidying up and so on will will i mean it is the same amount of tidying up and cleaning and taking out the rubbish immediately if you are eating it together or if you are doing it alone and so it is more work to do it alone than to to do it with other people i feel like you you know i i feel like as students go we both better cook for a lot of students particularly like when we are in the 1st the like 1st 2nd 3rd years i think when you get into the later years of the degree people generally have learned how to cook by then  but i i i still feel it is frustrating when you know the idea of student cooking a lot of it is because i just do not have time to prepare big meals cause it is just me i am kind of okay to cook for just me but if i am you know and i do not mind if it is if it is like simple food or repetitive food but if i am cooking for somebody else or my family i am then a much better cook than i normally am so it is not that i can not cook it is just that you know you do not want to put in all that effort when it is just for you yourself yeah you know that you are a good you do not have to prove it to yourself also like i mean i know i know some people do bulk cooking and then just eat it for a couple of days but i am always a bit like 1st of all if i have this food sitting in the fridge i feel really bad about it and i feel like i have to finish it and i also feel like i have to finish it within 2 days or something because i think otherwise it will go bad and it it sort of puts pressure on me and  i i will then definitely have to eat it because i do not want to chuck it but i i do not know i am i am not i am not a good bulk cook maybe maybe it is it is better if you have more freezer space and you can actually store it for a bit longer that would be nice yeah yeah i i hate reheating food from the freezer though it takes forever i just i have it in the fridge because like i am dead paranoid about stuff going off but i figured that if it is only vegetables it can be in the fridge for 3 or or maybe like 3.54 days and it will be okay like if it is vegetable soup yeah yeah i mean and it is an airtight container that is all right and then i can just i do not have to worry about i can just heat it up yeah yeah definitely also i mean yeah going to uni the heating up thing is also a problem yeah that is it it is just so hard to like travel with it because the library does not do you know yeah yeah they have microwaves i see why they have microwaves but then the study room in the english block have a microwave and that is very useful because you can just go you know heat the whole thing up true true true how how do you feel your your food habits will change when when you graduate i have a partner do something else or something differently well i am going to cook for my family when i get home and it is it is useful now that one of my brothers has moved out because he is a vegan so i will have to think about that  but that still leaves my youngest brother who only eats quite specific things and then he will not eat food that is in the wrong way and then my dad eats normally but he does not like soup and my mom is a pescatarian but nonetheless i am going to be cooking now so i i guess i am going to be thinking creatively  but it is not every day and it is i am staying there paying little or no rent it is it is the least that i can do so i think i will just get much more inventive  and i think i will learn not to stress about it so much because i just physically can not stress about if this is perfect or not if i am cooking at 3 days a week my response like would be well if you if you would rather have something else for dinner you can make it yourself then yeah yeah because you know i am the one cooking tonight and you all are going to get what i cook but then the the other thing is when i move in with my partner he eats a lot a lot of meat i do not we will have to work that out somehow yeah i mean i am i am sure wherever you go you you might be able to find a good sustainable meat source and i do not know but there are also stuff out there like sort of subscription based things that you can can get it directly from the producer or something like that and then yeah you can sort of get get some good good kinds of meat every every week and get that directly from from some i do not know local farm or something like that and support some sort of local business and so on yeah might might be able to to get something like that see my worry about that is like the chicken and stuff i understand it completely if it is high welfare that would be fantastic that does not trouble me that much however they are like steak cows are already massive c 2 producers  so the the environmental worry for me will be to stick to basically which sort of animal i go for whereas you just tend not to eat meat at all but i i think you said you do eat meat sometimes if it has been like and i am thinking you said hunted or something can not remember it well no i i do not eat any meat because i do not like wild meat and no did you not eat something that someone had hunted for you at some point or i am not remembering well yes well my my okay in the past friends do like wild wild meat but that was one of my reasons for going vegetarian because i do not like wild meat 0 my goodness is it wild meat you mean the type of meat or the way it was taken no the type of meat so that is wild boar or 0 like like game meat yes ah not a huge fan i feel there is something so medieval about going and cooking a pheasant  well i would love to do it once just to see what it is like there is something so base about it or or a slaughtered pheasants are so rare you can not you can not do that they do not have it they are farm pheasants okay yeah fair enough but then they are not wild the thing is rare as swans but i am not allowed to kill it i had a friend actually when you was at uni he had a a student living with him who got ex like kicked out of uni permanently because he killed a swan he was not mad or anything he just like saw it in a pond and was like well i am going to have that and took it home desperate i just i just think that was quite strange i do not think i would ever want meat like that badly to just like pick up a duck and go home with it i do not know where that duck has been nope me me neither (EDACC-C11-00)
hi i am participant c 33 b dash p 2 hi i am participant c 33 b dash p one i am going to read the passage please call stella ask her to bring these things with her from the store 6 spoons of fresh snow peas 5 thick slabs of blue cheese and maybe a snack for her brother bob we also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids she can scoop these things into 3 red bags and we will go meet her wednesday at the train station i will now read the little passage please call stella ask her to bring these things with her from the store 6 spoons of fresh snow peas 5 thick slabs of blue cheese and maybe a snack for her brother bob we also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids she can scoop these things into 3 red bags and we will go meet her wednesday at the train station beautiful thank you should we talk about our favorite things about edinburgh yeah that stood out to me do you want to start yeah i think like compared with living in london before i like like the scale of edinburg i like the fact you can walk everywhere and like being able to leave somewhere like when you are tired and i am not needing to spend like an hour getting home on the tube is so nice like no matter kind of where i am in the city it is like it is going to take me half an hour to get home either by bus or walking which i really like like i think well you have said this before like i do think it is kind of annoying that it it is not always the best city to be a pedestrian in but i yeah i just like i like the scale of the city how about you okay so the 1st thing that i did notice moving here is like i think the people of i do not know if this applies to all people in the uk but i i i feel the people in edinburgh are very open and like easy to talk to and it is very easy to make friends and meet new people in edinburgh one thing yeah that is definitely not true of london that is definitely not the whole uk one thing that has like now recently a thing that i have started to like more and more is the biking infrastructure not necessarily in the sector but sort of around edinburgh it is so nice to just bike sort of in the in the is it called the city proper of edinburgh like they have really good yeah i think i know what you mean really good like these biking highways and you can go very far on a bike and just like see you know old castles the nature and the beach i really really appreciate that about the edinburgh yeah i need to rent a bike and come with you one of these trips awesome i have not cycled i have not cycled in so long like i wa i do not know cycling in london seemed kind of terrifying i did cycle a bit at uni but it was such a small city i always thought like where my accommodation was and where my lectures were i might as well have just walked pretty much because it was quicker to walk through like the footpaths than bike around so i did not use it that much yeah right yeah it it was definitely terrifying to start biking in edinburgh like i literally i i think i just like carried the bike most of the way back from from portobello but yeah it is gotten easier now thankfully most drivers are you know aware of cyclists and so yeah getting easier and easier how do you find biking up the hills because that is the thing i am like uhh this was one thing that i yeah i i meant to mention as well so from edinburgh to the west it is all quite flat and you know decent and you know very chill everything up to the south sort of southeast and actually southwest as well is like terrifyingly hilly  and i i still have not challenged myself to do any sort of like a long biking tour in those directions but i mean along the coast either to the west or to the east so to east towards north berwick or to the west towards bo ness is very very manageable for like everyone  i would say i would like to get like yeah get out of edinburgh more just cause like i do not know there is so much beautiful countryside around that you do not really need to travel very far to see like going like when i went to loch lomond recently like that was so nice and like i probably yeah i could like rent a car or i think that is public transport to get there it is just like a little bit more awkward than renting a car but like it how how long was the drive there i feel like it was definitely less than 2 hours okay maybe like an hour and a half okay yeah something like that and like yeah there is just so many places like when i went on holiday last year like we went up to the south of the cairngorms and again it was like a couple of hours drive and it was like such such beautiful countryside and so different from where i grew up as well which is nice like and yeah like the other day i went to go pick up some furniture from kind of like southwest edinburgh from like a 2nd 100 furniture store and i came across this really really pretty like flower garden i have never and like i i dunno i want to like explore outside of my like little bubble of like where i left to the uni which is like fucking so small i want to see more of that this is exactly my experience as well i felt like i was always going sort of the same routes and seeing the same things every day and then now that i have the bike and just like you know taking that as just like if if i want to exercise instead of just you know running on a treadmill and seeing nothing for an hour just like bike and just yeah i have never i never liked treadmills for that reason no and just like if i am if i am going to run i want to see like i used to when i ran a lot in london i used to like i had a watch it was not quite as sophisticated as like a garment or whatever but it told you where you would come from like it pointed a little arrow as to how to get back home and kind of match your route on a little line so like if you were out for a run it would be you could kind of look like it would not show you the roads but it would show you like okay so i ran like southeast and southwest for a bit and so i need to kind of retrace my steps and it was really nice cause i mean i felt freer to like run around my area and not really plan my route particularly but i knew i could get home quite easily and yeah it is just like a nice way to see a city like i think the problem is where i am now i always just end up running you know like around like the meadows and that is just all i do and i am just a bit bored of it but i am enjoying going to the uni gym getting lifting weights yeah how are you finding pleasance yeah i think like i have gotten to a good schedule now it is not too busy when i go cause it is quite late in the evenings and i guess most people work out like straight after work whatever i am there when it is like all the fucking bros not not like not like anyone is being bro y but it is like pretty much in all guys i guess maybe that is true for a weight lifting gym a lot of the time but yeah that will be like i do not know there is like a couple guys i am starting to recognize who like work out in pairs and they like hype each other up and stuff which is sweet but i was wearing i got a free t shirt at a conference recently for an ai company and i was wearing that as workout gear and then multiple people came up to me to be like what is it like working for them and i was like i am not i am not real like i am not real i was like this would a good way to like if like pick up guys at a gym it is just like all the like yeah tech all the tech bros come swarming and i am like yeah but no i was like i do not work for them i just they gave me this free t shirt but now i do not want to wear it to the gym because it is just really awkward like i am just like no i mean i do not have a job just i am free  i just i could not turn down free clothes  i am i am the opposite of what you are expecting yeah yeah it happened like twice and the 1st time i was like 0 this is kind funny the 2nd time i was like i need to stop wearing this t shirt too too cringe unwanted the attention yeah they were very friendly it was just like awkward cause i was just like no i am not i am not really like a real person who works for this company i am just like poor and wanted a free t shirt yeah i mean like i i am hoping to be going more to the gym this summer i hope what what they say is true that like during summer it kinda drops down in terms of attendance because now after covid restrictions kinda lifted it has been so busy there when do you tend to go when yeah you mean when during the week or just is when i am back yeah like no like when during the week like what kinda time 0 i do not know i like to go as many times as possible but some time like i i i would typically go in the afternoon because i feel like i i am the i am the type of like worker or like like my work habit is that like it needs i require a lot of time to sort of get in the mood of working and once i am there i am like so fixated on what i am doing but any interruption will just like rip me out of that so if i try to like split the day up with like pre workout then post workout it is like it has never worked for me so i try to do it either before i start working or after i work so it is either going to be you know in the morning or in the in the afternoon for me yeah yeah that is fair i think i would struggle to have like a mid day gym break yeah i really i really miss being able to so i used to work at a at a place that was just like just on top of a gym and i used to do exactly this like go at 12 every day and it was so nice because it you know you got a bit of a break from just work and back then i could sort of easily settle into just working again and it was really nice maybe i can just sort of re train that habit or yeah to get up why do you think why do you think it is changed because you are doing a phd now yeah it is just like different kind of work and and like it just requires you know different kinda thinking and and like stuff like back like i was just doing like web development and that is kinda like just like do this and do that and very like these steps that you just follow and it is easy to just jump back on that list of things you have to do  but yeah like i have i have literally when i have when i have broken up my during my phd i have literally like i i swear i had i had an idea  what was that idea again 0 so i feel like i like have so low control on whether my brain is in focus mode or not on focus mode so i have a list of things to do and i will either do them like not not like at the same time but i will sometimes like jump between things much more frequently and then sometimes i do get like quite in the zone but i have i do not try and like i guess like try and control when that happens cause my brain is just its own entity u i am also like i am a serial like what is it called like when you delay everything like procrastinator yes that that is what i am i am a procrastinator and it has always worked for me in the past because like stress has been kind of helpful it just like pushes me forward so like i i work you know just a tiny tiny amounts for the you know 1st 3 weeks and then i am like busy for the last week and now obviously i was you know moving to a different country during this annual review and 0 my god this this procrastination schedule did not work this time it was so hectic oof it was like the 1st time i have almost almost on like what is it called like like an all nighter all nighter  i have never done one of them i just do not think i i i like i just do not understand i guess cause i am like the opposite of a procrastinator like when i have something to do i want to do it straight away and i i have i was saying this the other day to my partner like i feel like on monday i am really really productive cause i will have a to do list and it is like my brain is like we must do everything like today it is like i generate and then i sort of tail off but it means that like if i am like where it tend it tended to be like if i was like revising for an exam i would have to try and like keep up the momentum cause i would start really early but i am okay i am going to stop revising now and then like you are revising for ages and then i just start start losing steam i did not do that for the exam we had recently to be fair that was more of a last minute scenario but like yeah i am trying to like yeah i noticed this yesterday that like mondays i kinda sort of start the day with this not like a panic but i like gah 0 my god i have so many things to do i have got to get them done and like more stuff does come out during the week to add to my to do list but yeah mondays it is like i kind of panic and try and do well i am like i try and do everything and then i am like 0 okay i actually did not need to like make yesterday quite as like is this like specific to like the phd or like in general or i think i would i do not i really hate doing things last minute like i just got so anxious and stressed out i am definitely like someone who likes to have like plans and know what to expect and stuff so like i have always been someone who like tries to to kind of like start things early and pace things yeah i just do not like that feeling of like being under pressure and not having enough time how about we talk about something less like stressful  and we can talk about holidays do you have any holidays planned i am going to disneyland 0 my god i am so excited i freaking love disneyland where in france yeah yeah and i am so excited i went with my the same friend i am going with like a few years ago we just had the best time and we were like we should just definitely just do this again i think we both have a similar approach of like i do not know we are quite like cynical people but there is like a special place in our heart for really childish things  like i am like very like capitalism this that and then i am just like but disney and like christmas  like i hate valentine is day cause i am like it is just this commercial nightmare blah blah blah blah blah but then i am like but christmas time i love it  so yeah i think like it kinda surprises people how much i love disneyland but i love disneyland just like the whole world they have created the amount of effort the fact that everyone is there just to like have a fun time be childish and like  i saw the funniest video the other day of like someone proposing at disneyland but they were standing in like like an area they were not meant to be in did you see this and the the staff member just like ran over and just like snatched the ring this guy should be fired by now what i i was a 100% with him 0 because like as soon as you let one couple do it everyone is going to do it and they are all going to be on the forbidden stage with like the pyrotechnics and stuff i was like i was like i bet they are trained to do that like it does not matter what people are doing if they are in a forbidden area you get them out of the way i was honestly like i was all for him i was like yes everyone in the comment obviously was like this guy like no one could be paying him enough to like be this much of a joy sucker or whatever like like why does this person hate love and i was like no snatch that ring to be honest based on the video it did not seem like it was his 1st rodeo snatching a ring no exactly i was like this probably happens all the time like people people were like 0 i would not get a photo where there is other people in the way i will stand in this like nice like stage area where there is no one there but as soon as you let one couple do it they are all going to be freaking doing it and like   yeah in public i i am basically i am just like always sided with serving staff over the public  i just feel like the public we suck like we deserve to have our ring snatched so so you have been once before to disneyland twice 0 twice before and was it both times in france yeah yeah i i have i have not been to any of the other ones i would like to go to the one in japan as part of my dream tour of japan i will do one day when i am finally fluent have you seen the the new mario world like no you told i think you were telling me about this though it is i think i have seen i think i have seen like a clip of it maybe it it it literally looks like like a super mario level like it is very like high detailed and like once you get into the park it is just like everything looks like a computer game and they have all these like you know if if there is like you know like in a mario game they will have like a question block and if you would like you know and punch it a coin will come out so like everyone when they come into the park they get like this little bracelet and then you can go punching question blocks around then you will like collect the coins onto your bracelet bling bling yeah yeah it is so like yeah so well done i really want to go there and if i am lucky i might be able to do like a short trip to japan after korea that is if they lift the traveling restrictions for japan which i would love i would love to go to japan i am really hoping that that will be like the bias related workshop or like conference in japan at some point that i can like go to i mean i want to go anyway and like it is one of the like i am not a big fan of like long haul flights for the environmental impact but it is not a country you can practically get to any other way  but i feel like yeah it would be like the dream holiday yeah like all all all these years of attempting to learn japanese finally worth it yeah i am just like i am very excited about the food in particular this is a food culture that i can really like you like japanese or korean or korean probably japanese as well i mean but yeah i i have a korean friend here in iceland and she she cooks the most amazing food it is just it is so like in some sense it kinda reminds me of like not taste wise but like traditional korean food kinda reminds me of traditional italian food in that it is very like few and simple ingredients that just together make something very amazing tasting obviously very different tasting foods but yeah may maybe that is how most traditional food is very simple but but that is not how like traditional french foods comes across to me that is very complicated and like a long process and and traditional british food is just like we had loads of meat so we ate the meat and then we how come traditional english food is like we mash together the spices we stole from various countries and some raisins and then we served it with a meat gruel delicious that is like like like a traditional christmas pudding minced pies it is just like spices and raisins spices and raisins you just like stir it what is a what is a gruel gruel i do not know like a thick sloppy gravy  yeah that is how i would describe a gruel  it is like a savory soupy sort of baby food ish type of thing like it is not like fancy it is an old fashioned term it is not something someone would like cook but you might describe something as a gruel like 0 it is like i do not i do not know if like if if you have noticed this or if there is any truth to this and you happen to know about like i feel like with like old you know culinary words often they kinda sound like what they would sound and like i feel like gruel just kind of sounds right for description you just made of it like an onomatopoeia almost yeah yeah that is like particularly to an icelandic like where like a stew is and like whenever i hear the word i just imagine like the sound of like a ladle going into a soup like pfft like yeah it could have an influence on what words stick like we do associate certain sounds with certain types of meaning like there is this test it is like kiki and the other one is called baba i think but there is like 2 shapes and you ask anyone like which one is kiki and which one is baba and kiki is the spiky one like obviously because like it is a spiky sound so it would not surprise me if like there is quite a lot like japanese language has a lot of sort of they call it it is called an onomatopoeia but it is not exactly onomatopoeia sometimes it is more obvious how the sounds are related to the thing but it is like 2 repeated sounds like pikapika but like sometimes it is more obvious how they are related to the onomatopoeia in the way i would understand it which is that it sounds like the noise the thing is making pikapika i mean obviously that is what pikachu says does that have a meaning i have a feeling it means something like yeah it does it means glitter i thought so it means it does mean something i thought it meant like flashing maybe it is glitter so yeah that is like an example of like a pattern there is a few more like they are obviously all immediately gone from my head but there is a few more like like i do not know just like repeated sound pairs like that kind of it is a bit like onomatopoeia there is a good bit in my favorite book where it talks about the fact that like glitter gleam and like glisten all sound like the thing the light is doing in those words like gleam is like shining and then glisten is like greasy and glitter is like sparkly sparkly kind of noises that is a good little a little passage yeah passage passage but like is it kiki baba is that the experiment kiki i think so it is one of them one of them is called kiki but i can not remember what the other one was called like bobo or baba or something like that yeah but it is like a round floofy shape it is like a cloud versus like a star kind of shape yeah but they have done it to people like all over the world and regardless of your native language it seems to be most people think kiki is a spiky shape i wonder if that has like changed a little bit after like you know kiki started meaning like let us have a kiki that is not general enough tha that is too obscure like because there is a club here in in in iceland called kiki and like now when someone says kiki to me i think of something like more you know soft and fluffy than before when it was more like you are you are maybe it will influence you average person  also you know about the experiment so it is not going to work on you anyway yeah i would be just be like 0 they are both soft and fluffy to me yeah yeah i do not think that is mainstream enough to have an influence so if we go back to disneyland is there anything in particular that you are like ex are you like excited for the rides or just the experience or the whole shebang like the rides i do like rides especially they are so good with the the way they use video as well is like really cool and then like we stayed in a hotel that was like designed like a castle not like the most expensive fancy one they offer but like one of the less fancy expensive ones it still had like a castle vibe like there was like random like medieval statues and stuff around the place like i like just like all the food being themed and like the different areas i like the exploring around like it is like there is a festival called boomtown which has a very different vibe but has a similar thing of like different worlds that you can go between so like you you are in like the kind of like slightly racist aladdin area and then you are in that slightly racist like what is the the one that was set in south america with the day of the dead stuff lo loco or something 0 yeah yeah coco coco coco in rio right yeah i think maybe i have not i have not seen it i have i have not seen a lot of the newer disneys  i am a i am i am an og disney fan but yeah i am just like you know there is like a kind of little like paddle boat so like some of the areas are not necessarily specific to like a movie i guess the paddle boat is like the very early like the 1st mickey mouse thing i think it is like well maybe it is the steamboat but but anyway like i i just yeah the go between the different worlds and like i do not know there is something nice about being there with people especially this time of year we are going like where everyone is loads of people there were like big fans and they have like matching t shirts saying like the girls disney trip 2022 whatever which and like they are wearing all matching ear buns it is sweet like people being that like hyped up yeah what about like like i have been thinking about going to what is it alton towers is that like 0 yeah that is good i have been obviously not as like themed or like pristine prestigious as as disneyland but like you know something close enough to edinburgh to travel to although i have to say like i have looked at traveling to that like alton towers is like in the middle of nowhere and it where is it again because i feel like i went there so it must be near where no not necessarily near where i grew up but like driving distance this from where i stoke on trent it is like wait is there is there another one there is one like out like between sheffield and birmingham is there another alton tower well i would not because i have been to alton towers but i do not remember driving that fricking far i guess i was not i was not the one driving i guess we just go especially where it is i am like that that would actually be really awkward to get to from where i come from because where i came from had no fucking roads that worked i do not remember going that far yeah it must have been a dream or maybe there is literally another one i do not know maybe i went to another i am going to into another one but the no i think went i am pretty certain i went to alton towers  and like i guess we just drove i was not the one driving so i was probably like asleep for half of it yeah the biggest one in iceland is like an amusement park ha it has a brilliant name like this it is so literal it is called and it means the family and farm animal park and and on the family side what they have is like a go kart track and like a you know the thing that spins when you ride on a horse a carousel carousel is it that is it yeah that is it when it comes to the family side and then they just have like cows and pigs that sounds like a village fair like there is like a like the village show or like the the county show that would happen like once a year and they would be like you know little an animal stuff and i like when i was growing up it was only the go kart thing there was no carousel i will go with you to alton towers i would love that yeah so so like i do not know this happened like maybe 10 years ago they were like okay we are going to add a thing to the park and there was like a special like group of people that went abroad and tested all sorts of new amusement park rides and they were like came back and they brought like a freaking carousel with them carousel is it i love the idea that they like i do not know got to england and then did not get any further than like a village fate over like 0 this must be the height of entertainment yeah 0 yeah 0 yeah i would love to go to alton towers like i really like rides and just you know i mean we we kind of did that once the the one in the meadows  almost puked to be honest i   they are always pretty rough i think those kind of ones the touring ones they always put me a little bit on edge because like i do not know something like alton towers i feel like i trust has like a regular maintenance schedule yeah i trust like not that the village y ones are not trustworthy because i think like but it is just like it is often they are both probably run by kids but at least the alton towers i feel like the kids are not being managed by other kids right right which is the vibe i get from most touring ones sometimes i do not know especially because the i think is the fact that like the touring ones are not like screwed into the ground that is what i want i want the reassurance that this thing has been like built into the concrete exactly and has not has not been like put up like 2 days prior as well yeah yeah yeah just like a little bit more like comfort i still go on those like touring ones and like they are fine i mean i am not dead yet so yeah but yeah so alton tower it is a little bit more like foundation well time is up time is up do we have a final message i think we just stop it there yeah all right (EDACC-C17-00)
okay i think it is recording and it should all go into their correct place so hi i am c 47 p one and you are hm hi i am c 47 p 2 perfect so i guess i can start reading the text and then we can switch to just chatting okay so please call stella ask her to bring these things with her from the store 6 spoons of fresh snow peas 5 thick slabs of blue cheese and maybe a snack for her brother bob we also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids she can scoop these things into 3 red bags and we will go meet her wednesday at the train station your turn okay please call stella ask her to bring these things with her from the store 6 spoons of fresh snow peas 5 thick slabs of blue cheese and maybe a snack for her brother bob we also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids she can scoop these things into 3 red bags and we will go meet her wednesday at the train station cool yep great so i think we are done now so we need to finish this conversation in 15 minutes so that would be 10 to i am actually not sure i think 15 minutes is the minimum but you can go on for longer well sure we we could go for longer but why yeah why do it yeah yeah yeah also i think zoom automatically started stopping at 40 minutes in 0 it used to be unlimited for 2 people but now for some reason it only allows you 40 minutes interesting very interesting yeah i wonder what changed but  i am pasting so they gave us some conversation topics 0 wow in case we did not know each other do we know each other i do not know do we i am not sure so yeah i suppose maybe we can talk about that considering we spoke yesterday and a few hours ago yeah sure why not okay yeah so but but yeah like before we can go into our 1st conversation i was going to ask do you do you what what did you do did you have dinner in the meantime yeah i did yep i did what what did you have spaghetti yeah spaghetti pasta cool cause every student has yeah pasta yeah yeah i think i have reached a point where i just could not eat any more penne pasta like even now it just makes me starve 0 wow so i never order it wow in a restaurant how often did you eat it though maybe once a week there was a time when i mean yeah okay that that sounds like my situation yeah yeah that is so yeah this is basically my situation right now so yeah i used to buy these jars of pasta sauce and i think i would probably use maybe 13rd or one half of it for one meal and then save the rest for another day and i would just feed myself like that wow okay yeah so i mean yeah my friends i i used to eat them with ketchup  the spaghetti but my friends made fun of me of that so right now that i just make my own sauces then yeah i mean were they italian your friends no they are not italian they are all bulgarian like yeah well i find that they think it is disgusting but i think they do not understand that is probably true i mean i i remember when we used to go to babichka is place and she she used to make i think spaghetti with ketchup and did we the grated kashkaval at least for me i think it was special occasions when that happened like feta cheese and yeah no but yeah that was a treat maybe maybe i did not go as often i think dad did that who did that dad but i am not sure yeah yeah i am p he probably still does it maybe i am confusing my memories as well he still does it yeah yeah yeah i guess i do not know for me when i move from one place to another it feels that all of my previous memories become so much more distant and like it is so much harder to access them  in yeah including recent memories for example things that happened before 2016 seem to me like in a different life so yeah that is possible yeah yeah i can start relating to that yeah i guess you still have not moved  enough exactly  hm do you want to go to the questions sure yeah which one grabs your attention i have not read them all so let me see did you ever play a sport or have another hobby as a kid did you play any sports i mean play sports i used to play yeah i played the water sports but i never like did play a certain sport for a long time  i started with i think table tennis when i was really young  before school even i did not wait for i have so so you have a memory of that yeah it was in the like i do not know what is the sports hall and  i am not sure what it is called but yeah  it was in the basement over there how old were you i i think i i was like 6  i i do not think i had started going to school back then i am not sure wow or 1st or 2nd grade something like that okay i was really young then i remember in school they gave like discounted lessons for proper tennis  so yeah 0 yeah i remember when you used yeah to go for that yeah yeah i went for that then one of my friends got kicked out from there from the tennis court why because he insulted on of the the coaches 0 no yeah do i know this person maybe no we should not be using any names yeah so let us keep this anonymous yep wow i still talk to him today but yeah okay well tell me after this call yeah i will tell you so yeah that was then i think i would did basketball  i played basketball for some time i think was it at school yeah it was at school in middle school like from like  5th to 6th grade i played basketball i feel like a really bad sister because i did not know i mean you were like you were i was away the whole time yeah you are away like but still like i i wish i knew all these details i mean i did not i did not practice basketball that often it was not like  that big of a big of a part of in my life so yeah  and then did you do it with friends no i did it alone i do not know why even  i think there was like one classmate who did and it was 0 cool you are playing basketball i want to try as well  yeah nice i was not great yeah i remember did you do anything else i did swimming for like i remember that one yeah yeah that that was quite a long time yeah did you do any sports by the way i do not remember you doing any sports not much i think i did maybe badminton when i badminton was in primary school okay at the sports hall as well maybe maybe for like 2 months probably and then i remember wow i was a month in and i was feeling like i have learned things i am progressing and then someone arrived and within 2 days she was better than i was after a whole month wow okay i just felt so bad and demotivated and i thought there was something wrong with me and i am not made for this a and yeah i ha i did not have a great self confidence back in the day especially about sports and then i did a little bit of swimming but like the 1st time i got a bad cold so then mom did not want to let me keep going of course of course of course and then the 2nd time i probably just started doing it again i can not remember after what time period maybe a year maybe a few months and i remember i hit my toe in like this little concrete platform thing that was on the ground i just did not see it and i was like walking and hit my toe what in the thing and then i i do not think i broke my toe but it was hurt so then i just did not go back forever i think i think that was the end wow cause i just thought this is not for me and then as you know i started doing dancing in high school and i decided probably yeah that this is the sport for me so yeah even though it is not very sporty i mean it is mostly intensive someway actually it can be it can be it is up to you if you are missing that okay yeah yeah i guess so okay so yeah and then since coming here i i did try running actually for a 0 wow little bit speaking one of the i remember questions here is about edinburgh back when i was doing my phd in the phd flat i used to run maybe every other sunday with my flatmates and 0 actually with one of my flatmates who shall not be named because of the experiment yeah privacy but exactly then the other flatmate joined us once and he was really badly hungover  and he was just so much better than both of us that is just so depressing i am really so yeah i think we stopped doing that i do not think hangover really affects your running performance maybe i i i do not know i guess it depends on yeah how sick you feel but yeah yeah it depends yeah hm yeah and i am now doing yoga which i would recommend to anyone yeah i remember one time when you went back for for holidays in bulgaria you wanted to go run and dad made fun of you that is a good environment to promote sporting activities right yep yep yep exactly yeah yeah i can not re did i go running in the end i think i probably did once and then yeah it was too intensive and i did not want to do it again the story of my life 0 i thought it was too awkward or something for you or maybe too awkward yeah  i think with these things it is just good to have really small goals like non almost nonexistent goals and then yeah hm i think it is easier the best thing is to have someone to do it with yeah ideally so both of you can yep yeah i deally that is right and it is really hard to find someone to do it though with though  in in yoga i was actually really lucky this year because one of my friends trained to be a yoga teacher and 0 wow she has this kind of really unlimited pass for this one yoga studio and she lives nearby and she tried to convince me to go with her sometimes so we started this routine on saturday morning we try to go to yoga and then after that we go out for coffee and breakfast or brunch which you make fun of yes brunch okay exactly brunch for old ladies yeah yeah and actually i think that became a really good routine because i now want to go even if we are not going to have brunch after that so yeah that is nice like it is now intrinsically rewarding as opposed to extrinsically so yep it is good i mean hm that is what i am doing right now with my roommate we are going  climbing together  yeah that is awesome if one of us yeah if one of us is feeling lazy the other one is pushing him to go so yeah but have you ever been the one who is pushing yeah i have 0 wow because yeah i am impressed wow yeah good so what what has it been like going climbing what kind of it is very fun level do you feel you are at at the moment do you i am still kind of beginner like  yeah but i am starting to the most promising the best thing with climbing is that you are there are different like levels and they are quite well planned out i think i should say  yeah and it is very clear when you are making progress like its really noticeable because there are so many levels you can go to and hm yeah you can like how many levels i mean i think like the levels start from 4 which is just like extremely easy stuff like anyone 1st time could do it and then they go up to like 789 so like right now i am at 66 b wow and they have like 6 b  which is it is sometimes tricky but they are not just difficult not that difficult hm but there are like when it gets to like way harder like it scales exponentially i should say  the levels so yeah 6 is pretty average still 7 is actually it does sounds like towards the upper end of the continuum no no no upper end is like 778 yeah okay this way i can get or like 6 c like these things for me right now are impossible although i am  doing grade 6 b  like i cannot even like get one hook correctly like i cannot stay on the wall hm for a 2nd so yeah okay well one of my friends occasionally he does climbing and he keeps talking about how much difference it makes what your body type is and true certain things that are super easy for a short person are really difficult for a tall person and vice versa exactly yeah yeah yeah this is exactly like  yeah sometimes because we are like a bit taller than av  than average we can just skip some holes  and this makes it like so much easier infinitely times more easier because if i were shorter person like i would actually have to do the difficult holes but yeah so yeah 0 so you can cheat yeah i i am literally we are literally cheating i see yeah but of course like when you have to squeeze or hold somewhere it can be bad if you are tall so yeah and yeah that same friend of mine finds that his finger strength is not very good like his joints are not very strong yeah well do you have that well yeah of course but for climbing like these fingers is the most important thing so  yeah so you develop it yeah that that is the thing yeah the main exercise is just to hold like hang  on just on your fingers  for as long as you can you used to do pull ups i remember and you were really good at that yeah does that help yeah it is mandatory like yeah okay yeah yeah it is pretty much mandatory that is why you have to be really good and you like sometimes there are a lot of things like on a lot of walls you just have to do them at an awkward angle you basically have to pull yourself up  and it requires a lot of strength  and or i think maybe yeah that is why it is not for me because i 0 well it depends well you know like walls that like it depends on the incline of the wall  like if the incline is i am not sure if it is negative but if it is swollen yeah yeah if it is like that yeah then you have to it it needs a lot of strength yeah but sometimes they are like slightly like negative i should say  so you can lean on the wall  and just balance which these are like way more fun for me yeah just doing some balancing so yeah sounds fun  that is good and have you ever met anyone through this mountain climbing 0 yeah for  yeah i have met 2 people which are like mutual friends of gergei 0  whoops i think that is a fairly common name yeah let us just say it should be okay yeah whoops yeah yeah i have met 2 friends okay i guess like mutual friends okay not going to say names of course do not yeah i i mean if you were going to say a name that is like a pretty common name so you can not really hm yeah but yeah speaking of names i i have been doing a little bit of you know part of my job is to record people for experiments as well yep and i am the recordings are supposed to be anonymous and  i am interacting with small children so 0 and i have to encourage them and keep them motivated to do the task so last it 0 when was it i think it was was it yesterday yeah it was yesterday it feels like ages ago i recorded this tiny kid and i said his name in one of the recordings so now i went back to the audio and it is easy enough to just cut out that yep specific word and now i am kind of challenging myself to cut it out in a way that it does not sound like there is anything missing so that is also possible to do often so yeah there are ways of modifying yeah it is possible recordings yeah hm yeah some of them although like how can you manage to keep the kids anonymous just 0 i mean you just do not or you just say you are and like 0 you are doing such a great job hard work well no no but what if the kid decides to say a name 0 no they do not how do you control them they do not really have a reason to cause i am asking them to say very specific words and also quite often although not always their intelligibility is quite low anyways so  even if they say something it will not be understood because of their condition so  yeah it is has not been a problem but i can imagine if we are having a conversation it could become one it is just me keeping them on task and the task is for them to read words so yeah 0 they are just reading words okay yeah exactly so it is not really conversational  yeah i am just looking at the other questions i think we are towards the end of this anyway but yeah i think so too  i think we are maybe i am not sure  do you have a timer or something like that i think we started at i should have but you know that would have been smart wow yeah you are the smart one in this family whoops yeah no so we i think we started at 35 past so yeah let me see yeah 0 i think we can turn yeah 20 minutes ago well we can talk for like 2 or 3 more minutes yeah just to round it up so what are your  plans for the rest of the evening my plan i am just going to play games with you have someone someone who not i mention yeah  and that is it and then i am going to go to sleep good you yeah i need to reply to work emails because i do not have work life balance and also get ready for a trip because tomorrow okay the person that i live with is going to come around and pick me up from work and work is in glasgow so  then we are going to drive off to this event for the weekend so i will not be home again for a couple of days  and i i feel a bit stressed out because i like being at home in the evenings and making myself wow cozy and comfortable wow okay but yeah socializing has to happen at some point they say it is good for you so that is true yeah yeah that is what i am going to do well you do not like going out do you not for a long time i like it in controlled amounts okay and knowing that i can always go back home okay but when we are going to be away in a social environment wow i can not just leave you know no going back it is like in the world of the rain soon yeah they go through the mindset more ye yeah yeah  cool i think we should be able to wrap this up yep i think so too okie doke let us that is enough yep yeah i am stopping it (EDACC-C22-00)
is it recording then or now it is recording okay i have a record button as well but it is okay it is fine okay so i think that you can start then i should state my participation number no yeah i am c 49 p one and i am c 49 p 2 now you should read the passage that you have in the document all right please call stella ask her to bring these things with her from the store 6 spoons of fresh snow peas 5 thick slabs of blue cheese and maybe a snack for her brother bob we also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids she can scoop these things into 3 red bags and we will go meet her wednesday at the train station okay i will read as well please call stella ask her to bring these things with her from the store 6 spoons of fresh snow peas 5 thick slabs of blue cheese and maybe a snack for her bro for her brother bob we also need as much pla a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids she can scoop these things into 3 red bags and we will go meet her wednesday at the train station okay so that was a weird passage and we can start talking about things so how are you doing i am fine i have had a busy week but now it is coming to an end and i have had some problems with my flatmates because they seem to be a bit dirty okay and you can say this out loud now without because maybe they know already yeah yeah they probably have already noticed that i am not very happy with the state of our house okay it is a problem so so wh which is the part that is more dirty would you say is is it the bathroom or in general the kitchen and stuff  or which is the part that that is more annoying to you i think there is not a specific part that is annoying it is just the accumulation of filth like when after many days okay in general yeah after many days you see a lot of dust in the stairs after many days you see a lot of breadcrumbs in the kitchen counter 0 no 0 no or when you see a lot of pubic hairs on the bathroom that accumulation that accumulation of filth in the in the sink no in the yes how you call it this thing where the water comes out like in the bath the drain in the bathtub the drain yeah yeah yeah in the drain yeah 0 no pubic hair in the drain also because because it is hor it is horrible yeah i am the only brunette but my 2 of my flatmates are slightly blonde so i know that all of those hairs are not mine how is the cleaning in your house do you live with flatmates or do live by yourself yeah yeah that is an interesting question because i think that right now i have flatmates but they are extremely clean 50 year old 60 year old flatmates which actually it is it is interesting because they they used to complain a lot about me so they are my parents and they used to complain a lot about me and i am complaining now about them because they have a cleaning lady that comes every day which i think is extreme and they get used to do some like the house is clean all the time but they can not leave everything there so someone cleans it out for them and i do not know it is a little bit disgusting and it is me complaining about them like can you please do it by yourself and not be so it is interesting i think that that this keeps happening you know that the kids are becoming parents at some and this is what do mean by that well that i think that that life you you start like being yourself in the parents when you are born and you end up being yourself in the parent when you die ah yeah yeah yeah yeah and and i think that now i i can see this little switch that i am telling them what they are doing wrong  and these things keep increasing i think every day yeah and month by month yeah i am doing i am studying a master is and we have a teaching assistant that is an italian guy that just had a newborn child and the other day we went to the pub and he was telling us i do not know a lot of things that i did not know about babies like for example you need to press them so they will shit 0 really 0 no they cannot shit by themselves 0 no really okay yeah it is a 11 month baby newborn he has but he was so amazed also at the whole process so so is that true is like a it is like a doll or something that you have to press yeah it is a doll completely completely yeah i think it is it is similar he was very sweet he was telling us like the whole process of his partner giving birth and i did not know he is really excited about it it is really sweet to see but there was i always wondered because he stays in the pub until very late with us and then who is pressing the kid to poop you know i guess yeah no but i think they organize themselves who is the the the pressing the pooping pressing the yeah because i think they are well organized though because i think she works during the day and she is with and his with the baby during the day okay yeah yeah that that is something very interesting for me how like now i have like couple of friends that have babies and it is interesting how they convert to slightly different strategies and yeah i mean at the end it seems that everything worked out but everyone have their own like strategies of yeah for instance i remember that used to wake up at 3 a m and he is with the baby until 7 or 8 a m while the other person is sleeping my brother and my sister in law they are crazy and there was no control at all but it worked out for them but i do not know it is like this thing that there is no rules about how to do and everyone converts to their own thing i think yeah yes yes yes but th those like the thing that he thinks that is the hardest is that he is not getting much sleep that he is really sleep deprived but he says that you kind of get used to it like he is like now i think if i have a night that i do not sleep well my whole day is ruined but if then you have a child then you are going to have a lot of nights that you do not sleep well you have to learn to live with it yeah yeah we used to be like that actually when i was in the us i used to sleep like super every day and suddenly i unable to sleep for 8 hours and i was like 0 fuck that is that is completely amazing you know like it could be yeah it was like that the your normal life is it becomes horrible and then suddenly when you have a good night of sleep then your day is amazing so it is a little bit yeah interesting yeah i have my father that is i told him that i would be in this conversation but he keeps texting me now asking things okay okay okay that is that is fine that is fine yeah we can look i i was i i was thinking that that is interesting because we are partners or associates yeah but there are some of the things that i i do not know about you and like like we propose some some conversation topics to have yes okay and the 1st one of them funny enough it is what is your favorite hobbies what is my favorite hobbies hobbies well because you know like we were like like we were looking for topics of conversation and i think that at that time we were having our conversation about hobbies and stuff i thought what people have in in the uk and i said hobbies then that is true that is true well i think this is a trap question because i do not believe in hobbies i think i think hobbies are also like they changed throughout the origin the country origin i think some countries we do not tend to have a lot of hobbies at at least i feel like in my surrounding friends in barcelona generally people go to the bar that is a hobby okay okay okay but if i ever had one hobby i do not know i am trying to think if i ever if just to choose one like like something that was close to be a hobby but it was it was not like maybe climbing at some point climbing huh 0 wow yes that is interesting yes that is interesting at some point yes i would go to there is a place in bercelona called la foixarda that is open if i want to go climb the open one or the the open one i i know la foixarda yeah the open one okay and then i would go to this boulder center so the tunnels right what you used to go to the tunnel yeah okay and there was these boulders center in called 10 fingers yeah yeah yeah yeah i was there during the opening actually really yeah yeah the 1st day where they opened 0 wow yes and then sometimes i would go on the weekend to climb but that was the closest to a hobby i think i have ever been okay okay but that was very nice actually it is a it is a very nice hobby i used to climb a lot as well i was not consider considering it a hobby it was more like 0 wow this will sound super cool a way of life no no no no no no i mean it is it is yeah can a hobby become a way of life yeah i think so so so a little bit yeah so so i had to stop to stop climbing i was climbing very strongly actually in edinburgh before meeting you again i think but very very strongly like i used to go there 4 times a week and training and stuff 0 wow yeah yeah yeah but suddenly i i i am like i think i i read somewhere that climbing is the the worst sport that you can do for your body or something like 0 really it is super bad yeah yeah yeah for all joints and stuff it is extremely bad you know this and skateboarding actually skateboarding no but but my best friend is used to be obsessed with skateboarding and i used to go with him at macba yes barcelona it is this like barcelona is one of the most famous street skate cities in the world yeah so all the pro skaters were coming to macba and i used to study in the university next to that place and max used to be there like doing skateboarding i used to watch him where did you study well i there was a library there 0 okay so i used to go there all the afternoons and when i finish i i used to go with max and max was doing nice but it it was interesting because you want to see him like doing some tricks and i thought wow that is very cool and everyone was like no no that is normal and when they do something that for me was not impressive everyone was like whaat everone applauding and stuff you know but you do not understand the the codes of skating i do not understand the codes of skating but it is interesting because they do and it is something very private or something and i remember there was a very nice guy that i got very not in love but it was like a very small child of like maybe 10 years old or something  called houston he was from the us i think i think he is jamaican or something with dreadlock like with 12 years old so so a small child like yeah yeah like a small adult in a way eh like a small adult in the body of a child a small adult yeah yeah yeah because he was like with this flow and using all the tricks and he was like 12 years old you know and everyone was like 0 and with the dreadlock you know he was super cute and his father was recording the videos as well and i thought that this was a very nice i dunno and i used to go there and max knew that i like him a lot like i like to watch him and every time that he was in barcelona i used to go there and just observe him i i like this interaction with him and now he is an adult and he is extremely famous and stuff really he is famous yeah yeah yes he he was famous already when he was 12 years old but they used to come there well famous in in the skate world in skate world yeah in the skate world which i dunno can be globally famous but yeah and climbing was a big part of my life as well we used to do road trips around europe climbing with with van and stuff and there i i i met a lot of people who were really crazy about climbing and it was a big part of their lives i think and how how did you start climbing that is an interesting question when i was 14 i think it was the 1st time that i started climbing because a friend of mine beto he he was a little bit like just strange because now i see him as like i do not understand why this was the case but he was like i had a lot of admiration for him and i remember actually i did telecos like the my telecommunications engineering because of him actually  and yeah i yeah so part of why i am it is for him i think i dunno i had a lot of admirations for this guy and he used to climb and when when winter i remember that i got some climbing shoes and we start climbing a lot and yeah i dunno i think that he he used to be like this badass guy and i was like 0 wow that is cool but then i i remember that that i started doing my own path through climbing  he was more like it is interesting because every climbing had climber had his own philosophy and i think that for beto was more al more like an alpinist in the sense of like his goal was to reach the top of a mountain  and i was more a sportist climber which means that you prefer to do tricks and you do not care about arriving like so so he for him his goal is to just do like a super big mountain let us say and if he is climbing in the middle he will climb for me climbing is by a goal by itself yeah i know what you mean okay that is that is all about hobbies favorite or less favorite game or sport or fame or music game game okay game that as a child or as an adult as a as an adult or as a child as a child because i will come out i will come out as quite a negative person that does not like hobbies and does not like games i know that i know that actually what do you do in your spare time i do go to the bar  i think i am an alcoholic i go to the bar i am an alcoholic no i have a game that i like it is called secret code and it is a card game that you play you make 2 teams with your friends and there is in each card there is a drawing and they are kind of very like drawings that have different elements in them ah 0 wow that is that i played this recently was it with you or no like very recently actually no i do not think i never played that with you who who i played this with ah with garcia and other people actually with alex that is not that is the only one i like actually because my former flatmates back in barcelona they used to do a lot of board games on sundays and they would huh invite people over and most of the time i would be hangover and that there was people in the living room but sometimes i would hang out with them and then one day this friend brought this game and i really liked it and it is the only game i ever bought i bought it for the house and that was it is this is this one that you have like drawings the recent drawings yes the recent drawings and then and then you have to say i dunno the red cup on the wall or something yeah so like you have a a little card with a secret code it is like you are a spy and then you have 5 cards by 5 cards on the table so you have got a card of how your secret code works which has 6 cards that are like blue and 6 are red ah okay no no no no i am talking about something completely different okay i thought it was a but it is not but then you say like 3 card 3 on  you can only say one word and the quantity of card so you have to try to find the relations between the drawings and discuss with your team but also i do not know i think i am not very good at playing games because i remember that sometimes when i play this game they would tell me i was cheating in the game 0 really yeah yeah because i was like doing gestures to my team so they would understand like no no no no and you cannot do any gestures i also like that game of putting little papers on your head 0 yeah yeah yeah yeah i like that one and and the one of like also putting words i think i like games with words and guessing and like mimicking and all of that but i do not like strategy games or games like risk or something like that or monopoly i think i like fast paced games what games do you like yeah that is interesting i do not like board games in general actually so when i say that it was a like like this type of magical thing that happens to us sometimes it is because the other day i was with and and the blowpipe blow gu gun guy guy blowgun guy and we were playing a game but it was very interesting actually they give you some some drawing like very strange drawing like super psychedelic somehow like with many strange elements non correlated strange elements that and then you have to say something say say what is your card about then everyone puts the card that is closer to what you said and then everyone has to guess who said what what is your card basically so you come with yeah maybe it is with the same cards that you play these both versions it is possible yeah i do not know but it was interesting actually it was very psychological i think but what what happens to me with board games is that i get bored yeah i get bored very very fast actually yeah me too it just just it takes me maybe one or 2 rounds to enjoy it i remember this i did not understand it much i i like that one i remember but to a certain yeah but point once you have played once or twice it is a bit like yeah okay okay we are trying to be ready when we know it yeah yeah yeah it is it is just 11 round game but yeah it is interesting because there in my university in edinburgh everyone is like crazy it is crazy yeah i have not seen it much yeah in all my life is there any we are not playing any any games that you remember playing throughout your life not only not only like board games but as a child or sometimes 0 yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah i used to play a lot of video games actually and i there is this theory i do not know patrick that is one of for me is one of the most brilliant researchers from the next generation so i have my advisor my advisor is generation one let us say that next generation was taylor i think  and i am a generation 2 so i think that taylor is one of the for me he is one of the best ones and actually he was working on medication at some point as well and i remember that he told me once that he heard the theory that people who played games when they were young and stuff it made them think in a different way and i actually actually after sometime i i have seen a lot of examples of people who were very good at playing games and spend a lot of time playing games when they were young and now are crazy with at research and computer science and other stuff so like my oldest brother my oldest brother spend a lot of time playing your oldest brother your older brother is one example actually i remember that you told me and i thought 0 that is that was i good example oriol vinyals who is one of the leads of deepmind which is a company in in london he used to be a champion on starc starcraft  which is a which is a game it is it is like players i do not know if you know it is like you have to build a city and then destroy other cities and stuff it is like risk or something but with video games and interestingly he later on he thought okay if a machine can solve that problem of playing that game we will will be in a step forward for artificial intelligence and he spent the last 10 years like working on an algorithm that can play that game and 0 and beat professional players but yeah there is something that that our parents tend to think that okay we are losing time but i think it it makes you like think in a more strategic way at least it it is i am very proud i am like proud i am like i think when you are playing that game you are ready to solve small tasks let us say you you yeah take the the the video game you divide them in small task and then you try to do you still play video games no actually i bought one so so i used to play a lot one video game called zelda yes which is i know zelda you know you know zelda okay so i was so i accept this melancholy for me like because i remember spending a lot of time and remembering creating a lot with the story when i was young and i do not remember 2 or 3 years ago i said okay i will buy a console and i bought a console i am very bad at playing games by way so i i am not good at all and i got a console just to play the new version of zelda and i have it here but i i have never played it maybe i played 4 or 6 times i do not know but i am very bad at it but i have it here and i hope also because i have manel now i hope that he will get a console and i can play with him or something yeah that is nice yeah manel is my nephew and yeah anyway uncomfortable silence i do not know no not uncomfor uncomfortable it is comfortable it is a comfortable silence yeah so if you could go to holidays anywhere  you cannot say turkey where where would that be where would that be i do not i do not know right now i think i really like the idea of of going on holidays to visit friends and that live in a place  because for me it changes a lot the experience of going so i think i would like to go to mexico i have never been okay now i have you have never been to mexico really no 0 wow that is surprising because you have been 0 no no yeah i have been to mexico i have been to mexico actually up to the south of mexico because you exactly exactly yeah and then i went to mexico city okay so i i have friends there as well yeah that can be a good holiday then but someone that i know very closely and really had idea about going to china and in the beginning i was a skeptic like china what but now as time goes by i think that it can be more and more interesting and i have a good friend that live many years in china so maybe that could be a place to visit with this person that really likes  china those are the things i do not know but yeah i really like the idea of of connecting up a place with the people that is there i generally like  south america a lot i have been there for a bit but there is something there that i really enjoy would you like to visit some more places in south america because you have been to many parts of yeah i think i would like to visit argentina i have never been i would like to visit brazil  yeah those are places that i have not been to yet central america i would also think i know i think there is something nice about the fact that since i speak spanish and you can connect very quickly with people and okay relate in a way that some maybe somewhere else it is harder sometimes and with my english but at the same time i think there is also something nice when when you cannot communicate because it is a foreign language there is like like a sense of opacity of not completely understanding but it is also nice when it is traveling  i think i do not like the idea of do you enjoy the that that feeling in what do you enjoy that feeling of n like not being able to it is opacity feeling i completely understand i think yes i think there is this idea of also like going somewhere and completely understanding something i think it is a bit off as an idea    because like it is impossible to understand like a whole history or a whole culture with a few days and one has to like understand that you will never actually like know what is really behind a lot of things i think i i i got at this feeling when i was i lived one year in haiti and there was a lot of things  i could not understand there of the culture and at that moment i really had like this whole mindset of wanting to understand everything  and i think it has not been like after a few years that a lot of the experiences i had there for me were very strange or well i was not completely comfortable with those experiences because i think i was trying to match to make sense of things that sometimes my rationality is not enough to make sense of or that i do not understand the the complexity and i was actually having a conversation with a friend here from my masters that had been in south africa for a week and he was saying no about things that you cannot really completely understand because some histories and some cultures are another form of life and that one thing to access completely that is is in a way like a wrong way to position yourself towards it yeah yeah that is that is that is super interesting actually what you are saying like there are 2 things here i think the 1st one is that these rationalities are extremely cultural i think  like we we think in terms of our culture and i think that this is a little bit dangerous and this is the 2nd thing because it is something that i do not like and when i see like like my s suddenly i have try to like this thing of like try to personality about things it makes me think a little bit of colonizing or something like yeah you know like like you you see people doing things in a strange way and you start judging it and it is like well i mean yeah it is it is it is like you start judging from this position and suddenly you have like it it is happened to me a lot i am not criticizing because i think it is something completely normal and you have to travel a lot and to be exposed to these situations quite often  and like for me i remember in the us i was like judging all the time like 0 these people are eating that or are doing are doing that and that was and now when i think about it like from a from a from the distance it was a little bit yeah yeah patronizing i mean in certain cultures patronizing yeah is patronizing and is and in other cultures is colonial like for example me not understan like i lived in a very rural place in in haiti and there was a lot of spiritism and black magic  and a lot of ways of relating to the world from a sense that being a western person white with a very rational background and rational history of my culture i would question a lot  what they were telling me and like even question it from a humorous side but i do not know i i think like maybe maybe not questioning so much and and letting like be more part of it i mean i did in some ways but sometimes i think i was also questioning a lot or like a part of me i still does not believe that that man in the market was a zombie because  they they were telling me now in the market there is a zombie like blank i said shut up like you do not want to believe but it is like this  and i do not know i mean there is other ways of of experimenting the world than like really putting aside for this whole rationality is accepting that it is not our way is not the best way maybe or the only way know exactly exactly yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah that is that is the interesting part i think like for me it has been always observe like well not always but but learning how to observe without judging because when you start for me when you see this conversation about zombies et cetera and we start saying 0 i do not like that it is like putting some boundaries in the exploration of the world i would say  like for me it is interesting to not have any boundaries and see what you are receiving this could be also dangerous because there are ethical things that i am completely i completely disagree for instance there is a chance that i have to go to qa qatar this this this year for a conference i did not know that and yeah yeah but this is very recent actually but this will be later on in the in the year not in in september october but maybe mh on november or something i do not know but but there i will have this problem because i am like i have this kind of liberalism about thinking about people et cetera  but then suddenly i will find myself in a society that i disagree with many many things  about ethical things about i do not know women is rights for instance  or racism or or many things that i think are very wrong in that country and then it is like what how should i behave and this a very tricky question actually yeah although like i feel like certain ways of ruling a a country or certain thoughts built on an oppressive understanding  and i think for me that oppression is problematic either if it is rational or if it is unrational  it is problematic but then there is like another layer to it which this difference between rationality and and that and what is not and i do not know enemies and unrational of course treaties and more  yeah i would not like to i do not like to call it unrational because that is like in a way already patronizing yeah yeah but i do not know exactly the words i tend to think there is one funny thing that yeah maybe maybe for for me i always thought that religion have something interesting is that they will tell about community and the good people actually i have one friend of mine in edinburgh well now she will know who she is but she is she is she is mormon  and one thing that surprised me a lot is that she is one of the best person that i have ever known and i think that there is this part i i do not know i mean it is very hard to tell but  i think that that that religions have a lot do with that actually it at least christianism i know that maybe it is not perfect but at least at the beginning of times it made me think that that being religious makes you can make you a good person and this could be useful at this beginning of whenever everything like there was no ethics or something  and i think that that their religion had had had a good point let us say then but it was not so but then religion is also an institution and a generation of structures of our i think i think like it is different when religion is something you experience within yourself and then when it becomes this structure this institution  to rule there is it is it is when you believe it in yourself it is spirituality i think and yeah when it becomes structural it is religion  i think are you religious can i ask that question yeah yeah you can ask that question i think what if i say yes you imagine now yes i am i am muslim no no no no no no no i i am not religious i say i am saying this because i am from spain so it could not make that much sense i think but no no no i i am not religious but i am very interested in religion actually wherenever i can i i have a good friend of mine who is muslim as well and we i talk a lot about about muslims and mus how it is called the religion islam islam i loved islam and and about christianism and stuff i am very interested on because i am very spiritual i think but 0 religious yeah so what what about you ha have you been baptized or something i i am bap baptized by the way yes i baptized and i did my 1st communion 0 wow 0 wow yeah i went to i went to catechesis you are at a nice level in the game yeah yeah you have been in the game i went to catechesis for 2 years 0 wow catechesis is like and i i sometimes go to church with my grandmother i like go with along her or in christmas 0 that is that is sweet if my if my mother wants to go to church i might go to her i actually like i do not completely dislike going to church huh okay there is a there is a certain like not as in as in the already but there is something that is not on nice for me of being in a church i like the calmness that there is inside  and i like the voice of the priest like when it is like it depends like there is a priest that is like sermonizing and telling you but then there is like this priest that has a like a tone of voice that is a bit transcendental and there is something i i do not completely dislike about the church i actually like a lot e entering church i remember i had like a big fight about this when i was 16 with my friends in high school they took us to salamanca huh and i really wanted to go see the churches and my friends obviously did not want because in yourself and and the kids are really like against religion sometimes huh huh i would struggle because i i would not consider myself religious but there was something yeah i do not know if it is because i had an upbringing more near church that i have a different relation to that space yeah i remember having a big fight with with this friend because i wanted to go and she was saying like priests rape children 0 no and i was like but it was like but you cannot really use religion to that but i did not know how to articulate it very well at that time it was more of an intuition of why i did like church as a space i also like i am really amazed architectonically with churches generally yeah yeah they are impressive yeah actually the the book that i have from rafael moneo  it is about a church that was designed by le corbusier 0 really le corbusier interesting yeah yeah yeah it is called well i will i will i will send it later on but yeah there is i am i am amazed at that there is one artist called tim hecker  sound artist and he did a phd in i think in london and it would be extremely magical that it was in france exactly like that i do not think that it would be but it is like the typical thing that maybe would be done there he a phd on noise actually  what noise represents i think that the meeting is finishing so yeah i am seeing that as well we have to break should i stop the recording yeah stop stop recording and then we can (EDACC-C23_P1)
so what is what was happening it was about because the cleaning yeah because my family is visiting this weekend but i was a bit i do not know i did not think that it was so hard to get reservations in london for everything but it is 0 wow it is yeah very hard yeah so yeah i am it is a bit of a mess because everything was booked and i only find things for very late at night and they are a bit like pissed they are not pissed they are okay but they are like a bit to be honest yeah a little bit annoyed or anxious okay it will be fine it will be fine yeah which which places are you planning to go for eating so yes so yeah my father likes to go shopping and eating okay that is what he likes to do when his hobbies huh his hobbies then yeah shopping and eating yeah those are his hobbies so now i left him with his girlfriend to go and shop this morning and they can go shopping together okay and then i will meet them for the eating part he also likes drinking cocktails 0 really he likes drinking cocktails huh yes a lot he likes it i i have i have a couple of cocktail bars in london 0 that is cool because i only know one that they went to that i like i really like but if you have a list maybe it is nice i can see if i can i can i can i can share it with you yes he actually took a picture of me yesterday i can send it to you drinking a cocktail with him 0 wow okay which cocktail do you order so the 1st time we were having cocktails i had a vodka tonic and then okay had litchi martinis li litchi martinis you explained to me yesterday yeah yeah yeah yes i remember that yeah i remember that those are simple ones i remember very i do not like cocktails actually i think there are too like do you know alex our friend is is is special in cocktail making i did not know i feel like i i find cocktails generally are are a bit too sweet yeah i do not like the sweetness of the cocktails i do like them for example i do like splits or when it is apricot and like it is a bit more bitter  but i am also like quite like for example i like vodka tonic a lot it is more dry maybe than not that sweet i think yeah yeah yeah i usually order whiskey it is not because i am living in edinburgh but because i do not know there is this thing of the colors and stuff i find it gets not gets but i do not know like yeah i know what you mean generally me too i am not a big it is not my thing but people some people really like them like f this fanciness of like yeah  yeah i think my father likes them because he cannot walk a lot  and he likes a lot conversating so yeah that is that is why he likes cocktails i think yes because he likes to drink and talking because like and they are fancy and they are fancy and he likes things that are fancy okay yeah yeah i am i am going today to a very nice cocktail place actually talking about cocktail places with anna marie this friend of my father who is like 70 or something where and we are going to where is that place it is called tandem i never heard it i have you ever went okay you should go there with your father you will like it for sure i am i m i am certain that this one of those places that your father you know drink martinis yes he likes those okay yeah so so it is the same thing but very hidden actually it is it is more hidden it is like to be like for others it is extremely there is this one in barcelona that is extremely populated usually  like because it is very famous and it is very it is hard to find and also there is a martini this martini is the same thing that like very populated and also there is a lot of nightlife people i would say i would say that yeah like clerks of the night it is like clerks of the night but 60 year old clerk of the night with a lot of money which is the type of clerks of the night that we do not like i think yeah well i mean they are nice well there was not like do not like if they paid for your cocktails what i was about to say is like there is a clear age difference between boys and girls there yeah and for me it is something i am not very happy yeah because i i cannot avoid to suffer but anyway there is tandem and tandem is interesting because i think it is in in bulmers or busy street that is extremely crowded and you go to these places and it is super old i think in scotland they call it old old man pub but but very clean like everyone is suit up and and and and you have like these small spaces that you can be calm let us say without too much noises  yeah i do not know i like it and i am meeting there with the friend of my father today that is nice for a cocktail because i was talking with her i mean she is wait 12nd i need to get the charger of the computer 112nd of course yeah no worries take your time it does not work very well they match the the picture was amazing actually you looked great  so yeah i am meeting anna marie today and she is she is she is very like this is a friend of my father and  and yeah it is interesting actually the 70 year old woman that she always help me and she is a night clerk i think as well that is good we are night clerks as well you used to be i mean she is like this flippen and like does not engage with anyone like try to be yourself all your life and but but time i am i am convinced that i will convince her that it is not against permit anymore i think that is good tell me tell me about it after see how it goes i will i will i will yeah but maybe she convinces you otherwise no no no that would not happen but it is interesting because she is like yeah you have to enjoy life as much as possible somehow and it is so funny yeah i mean it is so funny i i like i believe that enjoyment is not an opposite to commitment but yeah yeah yeah yeah i also i understand discovered this that a lot of people do not feel like that but because maybe it is yeah other commitment that allowed them to enjoy a major different period of time i think yeah definitely and especially for a woman especially for a woman exactly but things were interesting actually i smoked my 1st cigar with her it is like this typical person who was like perverting you teaching me how to drive yeah perverting me a little bit yeah so we used to go like by car like go to like in in in a village in my village there there is an abandoned ski resort  and we used to go there by car she was teaching me how to drive by car and when we arrived at that age like okay no smoke cigarettes and we would smoke cigarettes okay so how old were you maybe 16 or something i do not know i could not drive i could not smoke like it was illegal yeah yeah yeah yeah so i it was i remember i i wanted to go with moto and i took me a long time to convince my mother to let me but then i did not know how to go with moto because i never learn how to go with a bicycle when i was a child 0 yeah i remember that as a child that is right so i actually like when i wanted to start going with moto i did not know how to do it and then ferrand that is a friend of my brother would teach me  with his moto but i would throw his moto to the floor so many times 0 wow really yeah like he 0 no was like 0 my god i cannot teach that child so yeah then i probably and yeah and i was older to go with bicycle well  one day maybe we go so you are going to be a moto mami i cannot be a moto mami but you are a moto papi i can be a moto papi what i wanted to say i wanted to say something about yeah that if someone says something to me with swimming actually i learned how to swim very very old actually when i was 16 0 wow no no more more more 18 18 or something but when you were still a child you did not go into the water yeah yeah yeah but i i i could swim like maybe like doing the frog style swim like you control yourself in water i control myself in water and i enjoy the water but i could not swim properly and now for some time i start like swimming properly and now everyone tells me that i swim very well actually really yeah because i i i have been like with other people like trying to yeah  but but doing crawl you know like being yeah i am a good swimmer i always swim when i was growing up really yeah 0 wow i go to the swimming class every week to swim and i i remember that in barcelona you used to swim actually yep yeah i miss it here now that it is summer and there is some lidos that i might go to and what is lidos lido is a swimming pool that is how they call it here when it is like a public swimming pool they call it lido okay interesting when i ask you for word you always say the word that lido  go on 0 well but yeah there is some here that are outdoors but in winter cause there is some that are indoors but they are a bit too crowded there is one in peckham but like it is full of children and old people and like there is no space to swim at all children old people look like it will be full of yeah and full of like i do not know my flatmate said that he once went to swim and then had like a very bad diarrhea for 3 days 0 wow got in the swimming pool 0 no i like outdoor swimming pools more than indoors  i i had one in barcelona that was like a 50 meter outdoor swimming pool outdoor 0 wow yeah but the water was warm was in hospital yeah it is in sun okay and the water is warm but it is outdoor and so amazing to because in barcelona like it is cold in winter they also have like an indoor one that is smaller 25 meters but in barcelona like if you have a sunny day in winter you can go to the outdoor swimming pool it is not that bad and i like that it being cold when getting out that was like for me one of the good moments of of of the of the week people sometimes complain because they say that when they swim they feel a bit like i do not know like hamsters on a week 0 yeah that is that is that is a good technology actually yeah yeah because people think a lot of how many swimming pools laps yeah laps they are doing but i generally i i i do it as i structure it  i say okay i will do i think i did 16 grow then 4 of i dunno what is it called frog yeah frog frog style frog style do you do other styles like like like butterfly style butterfly do you do butterfly yeah yeah but not much i feel a bit 0 messy when i do butterfly yeah yeah what of others and you have to teach me and and when whenever you arrive to the end of the lap you do the turnaround no no no okay but i really enjoy it and i really miss it here i think and it is a very complete sport yeah yeah yeah i used to do it a lot actually it was like when i was climbing a lot i used to do it like every 3 days as well so it is good for the back  it is good for the ass well really it gives you a good ass yeah it does it shapes your ass yeah yeah yeah because you do make like a lot of strength with your legs  i think it is just like it really stretches a lot of the muscles you you you know you know what i used to do with my mother when we were in la scala there was some periods of time like magically i do not know that my mother and i stayed in la scala together for one month or something  and is it was usually when i because while climbing i broke my ankle climbing that is very hard story i was in zillertal that is valley in in austria and when i was climbing i i because i i was with professional climbers okay here is when i started learning that something was a little bit funny and because everyone was climbing super fast i decided to skip some secure points while climbing  and i fell down 0 no and then yeah yeah it was pathetic i think i had to put my feet because i was feeling like i did a lot of  yeah yeah because i i did not have a good point so the the fall down was very hard you had to like climb together yeah yeah yeah yeah now i have these mistakes again so i i broke my ankle and then i went to la scala to recover for a month  and i remember that my mother used to tell me you have to walk in the sun and and even the physiotherapist recommended me that because that way your ankle is like the sun is interesting because it makes your feet to put in all kinds of position in a very soft way let us say and yeah what what i was doing is to swim in the sea but because i am very scared to go very very deep in the sea i was doing like like beaches let us say from yeah like following the coastline following the coastline yeah and i was following the coastline of la scala and it was very nice it was very nice and yeah that that is all that it was not a swimming pool but it was almost a swimming pool yeah i like a lot swimming in the sea as well in summer yeah i do that as well i take the glasses and i go yeah i really enjoy swimming if we in this summer we have to swim in turkey 0 yeah that is true we will go to the seaside and one thing that i would like to try at some point i do not know when and if i i could be able to but there is these spaces that have yeah yeah yeah yeah that must be super cool no i think with the look yeah cause you do not need to like lift up the the okay you can just yeah like that yeah yeah we have 4 more minutes do you want to talk about something else that maybe sure what was in the list that we have not covered so yeah i dunno i think that we covered so what is your favorite thing about edinburgh this is the last thing my favorite thing about edinburgh i do not know sorry that is not a very good answer no it is okay because i do not know edinburgh so so much i think my favorite thing well i really like the park that the park that is there is a tree that that my friend calls albert i really like that is my favorite thing that tree that tree yeah it is my favorite thing though we are we are connected there yeah what a coincidence yeah for for me it is the people i think i have been thinking a lot about it and it is beautiful the weather is horrible but i think that the best thing of edinburgh is the people and and the communities are created around pubs and how you meet them and i think it is something that it i think it becomes with the weather so people have to be to create more community because there is less things to do i think i dunno  but it is nice that people get in the bar in the pub and they are extremely open and friendly and they are always open to meet new people they like to yeah to create new links all the time  and it is something that is is amazing for me yeah that is nice what is your favorite thing about london 0 that is interesting yeah i like i i like peckham i think and i still i start thinking about why but i think because i think that i have this image of london of not being a neighborhood i used to not like it at all because i remember the city i do not know like this going the thing of going to a bar and only very close group of friends like simply divided and because i was coming from edinburgh i i remember that this contrast shocked me a lot like because i remember that i i went to a path in london just in i had a meeting or something and nobody talked to me nobody said anything to me  and that was weird you know and yeah even i i was feeling a little bit but when we were in peckham i think this although it did not happen that someone sit next to us i remember that people used to say hello in the streets yes so we do not have that in edinburgh but it was something close i think and finding this type of neighborhood like thing in london i think it was very nice so i would say that peckham is one of the things that i liked i think that that in in hackney they did not happen that much but yeah i dunno i i like this thing of like finding neighborhoods and it is very correlated with the wealth of the people of the place i think because edinburgh is another wealthy city i think  and these things get created and i i tend to like them a lot more than  yeah okay i think that that we are done we can we can finish okay bye bye nice conversation nice conversation (EDACC-C23_P2)
i think it is recording now  hi my participant number is c 51 p one well hello c 51 p one my participant number is c 51 p 2 nice to meet you i will read the passage now go for it please call stella ask her to bring these things with her from the store 6 spoons of fresh snow peas 5 thick slabs of blue cheese and maybe a snack for her brother bob we also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids she can scoop these things into 3 red bags and we will go meet her wednesday at the train station i will repeat it to make sure that we understand please call stella ask her to bring these things with her from the store 6 spoons of fresh snow peas 5 thick slabs of blue cheese and maybe a snack for her brother bob we also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids she can scoop these things into 3 red bags and we will go meet her wednesday at the train station perfect yeah also for all of these things i think red bags would be actually quite difficult to get  also yeah spoons of snow peas it is like measuring butter in cups looks like all these words are just selected to to actually test some some vowels so it is like the brown fox jumping you know like yeah probably covers a lot of phonetic phenomena yeah or maybe covers a lot of you know mergers stuff like that  used to identify your dialect well hope so that could be fun yes yeah so we need to talk about our trip that is yes what is upcoming okay so i have not actually looked into it other than looking at the car rental i mean i think so i think it would be good if you like make some you know a tiny bit of progress because my friend is is just she likes planning things in advance and then okay she can relax so she is unlike many other people in in terms of planning fair enough yes yeah i like it was strange for me to hire a car so far in advance  but also like if she is willing to do it that is that is fine that is like i do not want to put it on my credit card for 2 months yeah i think we can just ask her to do it she i am sure she will be fine with that so we just need to figure out maybe what how many drivers you want to add and what is the price difference but i guess the the thing you could do is just to send her the link and  maybe to suggest which car you think is good which car yeah what size yeah yeah it is kind of it is a shame that it is so unpredictable if they are going to upgrade you or not  cause quite often they do and then the cars are super great and the price differences are actually pretty large yeah well i guess for for one day or for 2 days it is one thing but i think we will probably have to good point not for a week we will probably have to do it yeah it is unlikely that we will get upgraded for a week if we actually do not book that now that is true yeah now you make the point i never rented a car for this long before yeah i do not know maybe a 1st we are going to make friends with the car okay never mind 0 but but i guess the question is do you do you want to be a driver or would you rather like 2 of them be drivers or something else i do not know or you do not care absolutely i do not care i do not know how good how well they drive my friend drives pretty well i think she grew she she grew up in some mountainy area which is yeah 0 then that is perfect yeah yeah i am totally fine with driving and i have driven in scotland before so you know i am comfortable with that i am not the best driver ever cause i am like driving really safe i think you are fine yeah yeah okay i do not know what you are talking about there is one time i drove a van at night with no lights with no what no lights i think so i think i had no lights 0 i do not know if there was no lights for my birthday you know yes  yes yeah that time  yeah i i like driving i will be i will be actually yes i would prefer yeah i want to be a driver because if it is really bad really bad with nausea okay i want to be able to drive okay maybe just me i mentioned all that in the yeah i will tell her i will tell her so that would be probably set and we need to to to develop the route i mean it is honestly it is mostly just on us right like because they they do not know  almost anything in scotland so whatever yeah i know if you have any i i i have not had time to check like what exactly i want to do but i think there are some good hikes in the north i think you know the more we spend time in the north the better it is for me sorry i just wanted to access the the sheet google sheets that they shared but all right yeah okay let us do that i do not have did you get access to that an access to that no you do okay that is great no i do not i do not 0 okay all right let me see if i can if i can share this with you otherwise i am afraid we will have to ask our friends otherwise that is fine i just so what i wanted to know now is exactly how many days we were planning and like was it leaving in the morning on the 1st day and stuff like that yes  so i think they are arriving on 14 august in the i do not know mid day or evening so they will sleep here one night and then we can leave anytime in the morning next day it is the on the 15th 15th i think okay that is good and so it is it is going to be 1516171819 and then 20 it says drive to edinburgh via loch ness i am not sure why okay so 5 full days it seems so 5 full days and like i think yeah 123456 wait 6 nights or what yeah i think 6 nights well because they were counting the night in edinburgh i believe 0 yes right so it is it is it is 5 nights camping so we can get back in the morning on the last day which is au august 20 then good okay  so let us look at the map yeah the question is like do you have do you already know of any places that you want to to see or we do do we like start from distilleries i think we start from the distilleries okay looks like we are going to oban the distillery it could be cool oban wait but it is not on the map is it no it is not okay so the map is yes i will explain then the map is very sparse because the definition of independent distillery is super strict  there is a lot of distilleries in scotland that are owned by large companies but they are like essentially they were just bought by somebody but are operated in the same way they used to be okay right so they are part of a it is a sort of large company but it literally changed the feel of the place so it is still interesting to visit and i think oban is one of those and so is the one on skye talisker right yeah but so wait if we if we get to drive to oban then we do not get to pass glen coe valley you know we no not necessarily we will pass next to it we could like drive there and back if we wanted to  cause if we go north from oban we will you know if you look at the map we will pass glen coe almost yes but no i do not mind if we make like how can we do you think we should do like 2 distilleries maybe i guess 2 or 3 i do not know or 5 days i mean i am sure they will be happy to do 3 i do not think i do not feel like i need to do 3 but i am i am okay unless they are super expensive yeah i will be fine with 2 so the thing is like i really want to go i think i am interested in going to like northwest scotland yes cause i have never been but there is no distilleries so we need to sort of cash them on the way wait wait wait so there are no distilleries whatsoever yeah or just like no independent ones or no interesting ones no no distilleries i will i will just send you a general map of scotland with distilleries there you go it seems to essentially like end on skye okay that makes sense and then there is a bunch in the east but i wonder why so how long is the drive from like skye to ullapool we will ask ask google skye to ullapool  0 it is not too bad it is like says 2 hours 27 minutes from the middle of skye 0 excellent so yeah just about 2 hours from from the bridge cool so we do not need to plan that long to get there yeah maybe we can just like spend there one night and even that is going to be fine for you know one.5 days yeah so like we could get there camp and do some hiking and either stay the night or like  move somewhere else in the evening yeah that sounds good  okay in that case we should at some point look for some hikes over there to know where exactly we would like to go yeah that is the the i think that would be the best area for hiking maybe plus skye obviously it is like i bring like the idea of maybe we could take a picture as we go back cause there is this road you know like on those prd clips yeah slightly west from ullapool right so maybe i am sure it is going to be longer but i would like to see those views i think so i am not sure curious what if we like drive there on the main like if you want to get to ullapool probably the most direct way is just to to drive you know via inverness and it might save us yeah quite some time would it make sense or not what should we do and we we drove from edinburgh there yes i mean it does make sense but it would mean that we spend like most of one day in a car 0 well we do not need to like drive directly there we can like stop you know after inverness for example or i do not know whatever is there  or like camp that at loch ness you know that is tempting actually 0 man we could yeah we could camp at loch ness and then i think somebody wanted to stay there or see loch ness and i like that i am so excited yeah they want they wanted to see it at least once i think so that is not bad we could do a day at loch ness the 1st day and i am sure there is like some hiking to be done so and the camping there is really nice yeah so i guess the question is what is what would be better to to drive because it is it is obviously easier to drive on the main road right so  it would save us some time so do we want to save time in the beginning or on the way back because we can also do the reverse no i i think i like it i like it more because it is like at 1st it is the places i know and i have been to yeah yeah but they have not been to and so it is like still exciting and fun yes but then the end of the trip is the beautiful things i have not seen yet and i am more excited about it and i want to remember it more okay yeah that is i am happy to do that yeah i am into that idea right okay so how long would the drive from from edinburgh to i do not know inverness be yeah that is probably like pretty fast actually right it is like 3 hours yeah 3 or 4 hours so and then we can turn you know turn left to to loch ness and like yeah 3 hours like 3.5 to get somewhere where we can camp yeah to a nice place for camping yeah yeah we can even get to the place you know where we  stop during during our so it is really good our canoe misfortunes i really enjoyed it there great it do you know that is a good option so we will be there like you know early afternoon yes so one i will take notes what needs to happen for planning one of the things is what to do at loch ness well i i think i actually think then we that we will have to stay to to get into one of the distilleries there you know because that path is actually full of distilleries 0 yeah good point so we can we can get some some some booze on the way the driver will have to wait for a bit but they probably would not mind it is fine the speyside but speyside is usually closed  for guests there is i think ed edradour in pitlochry never been there in pitlochry okay so speyside is actually closed i see i it is hardly ever open for visitors yeah i mean you can i mean i am i am happy to do that or whatever you say yeah but there is also like a little bit of a detour a little bit east there is tomintoul yeah benromach that would be cool benromach is it 0 it is kind of it is on the coast 0 on the coast okay up north from the coast yeah like a little bit east from inverness yes i see yeah  that sounds pretty nice i like ben benromach okay can we do that easily or is it like a big detour it is not a big detour cause it is on the main road yeah it actually there is actually even a a path from you know ardmore to to that place 0 yes yeah so in fact we are just like half an hour detour right which okay so is perfectly fine the days are so long so we can do that we can just like drive to the distillery and which means we are almost there right so from there  to to inverness into the camping place is is really easy yes so we can slowly get there and you know even if we get a car much much later than we plan for whatever circumstances we will still  not be stressed because it is a it is a relatively easy drive and we already see a lot and we can even like plan another stop on the way just you know to show them something if we want for example to do something in even in in cairngorm or whatever around that area in the cairngorms yeah we could go somewhere yeah well not i do not know not necessarily maybe entering there because it is if it is each day is a bit of rescinding and there is like there is a lot of small lot of small hikes small walks in the cairngorms that are like designed to show you you know waterfalls or okay yeah so so maybe we can like plan something like that and then we get to distillery and then we drive to inverness and to loch lomond and yeah just just camp there yeah that would be day one cool i am just checking if they have tours there is variety of tours in the distillery okay one of them lasts 2 hours and costs 75 quid interesting is there one that lasts less and costs less there is an hour and a half for £25 and an hour for £10 okay well we will decide yeah 0 i think the cheap one they do do not actually do a tasting they do not do a tasting huh it is like the £251 yeah yeah do is it would it be available can we already see the dates that they are open or not no you need to send a request which i will do okay yeah that is fine so you know the date that would be the 415th right yeah 15th what would be a reasonable time well let us say we are not doing it very hardcore so so we pick up the car at 9 yeah getting there from edinburgh is like 3.5 hours i think yes so i guess we would need and if we still want to stop then we probably need at least 3 more hours like 5 hours yeah i would even say like 6 so may if we can book it if we can book it for like 3 or 4 3 p m yeah maybe 4 is even better basically is like is possible i think i think 3 p m is the latest time okay of course can do this yeah we can we can do 3 then okay 4 people sent okay now let us see what they say we will is there anything to see in that area actually like in because i i do not know scotland you know north of cairngorms who does i do not know i have never been there i guess the coastal area is not is not like particularly fun because it is usually plain right so maybe no nothing to see there well that depends because you know i have been to the stenness forests and those in the coast  but up the walkhighlands let us see what do they say i mean i i guess we do not we do not have to do it like right now  just like we can we can do like a couple of we can spend a couple more hours around that area if we want to because i think even if we have a tour at like 4 i do not know or 3 the i mean they they end at 11 yeah by 5 well actually no it is going to be august 0 yeah good point good point so it is not it is not going to be 11 but i think so to 930 but still enough time probably to have a couple of hours extra yeah  okay so i guess okay so we we have a rudimentary plan we go to this area we want to camp at loch ness we will find something to some like hike to walk yeah whether it is more on the coast or more around loch ness yes but that depends on what we feel like and then from there we should probably get to to ullapool area now because that is we do not have time to lose in in the familiar familiar grounds okay so that is day 2 so we will probably go from yeah i it seems like a short drive from like something like what durness or whatever it is called to ullapool probabaly 2 hours yeah even less like 124 yeah i mean we can we can put more but it is it is fine yeah it is nice to plan for longer yeah and then we do not so we we do not need a distillery for that day  so we just probably do a do a proper we go for for look for whiskey so we can buy at the distillery shops because we have a car most often when i go to the distillery it is like hiking or you know carrying it in the backpack being on the train yeah just the possibilities are endless i have not thought about it before so i would actually i would say you know we will leave relatively early from from loch ness like get to ullapool and do a proper hike maybe that day because we will not be tired yet and the 1st day we will be sort of mostly driving and being lazy yes i agree that sounds like a good proper hiking which we will need to research yeah i mean i mean there are probably many places around that area i would be surprised if a lot of it a lot of it looks like it is either marshy or really well let us see no i might be very wrong actually no it is just mountains full of mountains so yeah hills one should say yeah and i think actually there are some some like pretty good one of the most beautiful mandrills are there it is like when i think at some point i looked up some something like you know 5 or 10 best hikes in scotland and usually there are a couple around that area and there might be also some very nice beaches as well so maybe we can also get there there might be yeah there also might be no beach no beaches whatsoever because it is like this cliff cliffie kind of end of scotland  anyway but this is the plan for our 2nd day i guess the question is so do we need to to look for a place there to sleep 0 right so how many nights do we want to to book the sleeping for one no i i mean like 2 i do not have any preference i i would be fine with one i see i i would honestly be fine camping the whole week but they wanted to book something yeah i think they wanted to well i guess yeah my take would be probably let us just plan around places we want to see huh and where we want to hike and then check in which of those places there is some like bed and breakfast or something available because i am sure not all of them will be having yeah you know some of the condition and then we just you know sleep in a normal place like those days yeah i think so i actually think this night might be good because we will be like pretty tired after the hike and also that area like maybe not the kind of place where all the tourists go i do not know yeah because all the tourists got to and we have a car so we can actually like drive to some town nearby yeah yeah yeah i do not to reach the accommodation i do not think there are like proper towns or settlements villages whatever you call it hamlets hamlets yeah are hamlets english more than scottish i do not know there are hamlets around around pentland so i am not sure yeah but maybe they are 0 yeah i searched hamlet in wikipedia this shows me the tragedy of hamlet prince of denmark this one what a surprise is not the content so clear i thought my computer is listening to me all the time yeah i am sure it is just pretending no no i do not know what you are talking about and in fact it is already like it is it is already designed a trip for us it just does not want to give it away you will see you will see whiskey ads all over the place for the next like 15 years well that will be pretty normal there is a scottish term it is called clachan not surprised may be preferred to the term hamlet it is a small settlement or hamlet on the island island of ireland the isle of man and scotland clachan i will translate it now well okay we will find we will find a clachan and sleep there  do we have i guess so my brain is i feel like i do not know that area so maybe there are very amazing things to do around you know ullapool and that area but of course skye is also wonderful so i i feel like i do not have enough data to make a decision about leaving you know ullapool that night or staying for another day yeah i do not know what is there in northwest scotland actually so what if we what if we start from from the end now okay so let us say like the very final day we will be just driving to edinburgh because one of them has a flight i think in the early afternoon yes but that was sorry i think the flight is the early afternoon on the 21st so if we wanted to push it as long as possible we would need to be back like by noon on the 21st but we could also just come back on the 20th are you but but are you sure because i think 21st is 0 no it is sunday yeah i am like 90% sure do i have anything in the group let me see because  that seems that sounds crucial i think we just talked about it or maybe i mean maybe like there was something maybe there was something before you joined let me see  yeah it is a bit confusing no i am afraid not we have to ask well that makes it kind of it makes it kind of difficult to plan to plan in advance because the last the last line in the spreadsheet just says drive to edinburgh via loch ness and that is that is day 7 so and day 1st includes arriving to edinburgh right let us like i will probably be s feel safer just planning on coming home the previous night well i i mean can we just actually cause like cause they have a flight at like one p m yeah i just like i do not know if they want to stay in edinburgh because it might be also like they do not have where to stay i mean i i i can i can maybe host them but i i do not know if like maybe they prefer to just sleep you know in the in the highlands and then wake up at 8 and drive up here yeah huh so we should discuss it next time we talk but in any so i would be happy to you know give somebody an air mattress and so 0 right you have an air mattress i do yeah okay because a friend of ours was wondering who can provide an air mattress but we will talk about it later okay okay okay so well so i guess the question is do we need to find a short drive on the morning of the last day or not okay so i think if we wanted to do that have a short drive home on the last day i would probably make it from the trossachs yeah that makes sense right cause it is a pretty place to stay yes and a short drive for sure and it is kind of on the way and with a car you can make it like pretty deep if you want yeah exactly to some actually nice place 0 my god we could even go to this restaurant the one which you huh the my my birthday restaurant that was so good 0 that one yeah it was fun i liked it a lot i do not even remember where it was it was kind of a bit out of the way you know i mean depends what way you are on it it was you know in one of those lochs i have it on the map i think do you remember the name or something v inver i n v e r  it is on i mean everything in scotland is called inver i think inver restaurants rooms okay next to a town called yes yes kendal banchory wha what 0 yes okay on the loch 0 yeah it is not too bad whose name i cannot find anywhere it is not too bad really it is not too bad i mean from from like the main way it is a  40 minute drive yeah and if we wanted to have fun we could even take a ferry from sort of like across loch long i believe and then going back to glasgow anyway yeah i think my i do not know i do not know how i feel about like waiting for ferries that is less less predictable i think 0 yeah especially if we are in a hurry okay fair enough yes that is fine so let us say that it is an option for our last night yeah just like some somewhere on the small loch in there  maybe this time there is fresh water i heard i do not know what you are referring to i just heard that whiskey goes better with fresh water rather than salty water i think it goes perfectly with slightly salty water that just comes to personal boils down to personal preferences i i i do not criticize your taste in any way boils down to a handful of salt that is what it boils down to that is a very reasonable comment cool so okay being in in the trossachs then could be a last night thing yep so if we wanted to do that we could probably also just like arrive there in the morning do some hike with dinner yeah and drive back home okay or i i mean i actually i do not know we do not need we do not need to to do a hike like in trossachs i do not feel the need to do that because you know to trossachs we can get any time that is true that is true if we have if we have like an extra day i would rather spend it you know like in glen coe or like that is very correct yes i think if i yeah if we if we could do a hike that day i would actually rather do it within glen coe area no good point okay so there is this one distillery on the west coast which is called ardnamurchan of course it is how else would it be called if you look at the map that is literally what came to my mind on the tip of my tongue yeah it is it it is out of the way i mean yes but also do we really get a way which is fine right i was just saying so it it just might take long to get there from anywhere else yeah so looks terrible actually i see we would need to from fort william i guess that is how we get there you know yeah unless we take a ferry from skye whi which would like save us some time i think there is no ferries from skye to there well okay yes yeah i think there is a ferry ferry to to mallaig right yeah yeah and then we can drive more easily rather than from fort william that could be fun it would be a scottish ferry experience yeah and that that would also give us extra like we do not need to hurry on the day maybe so we can actually afford to get ferry and it is a relatively short one and not on a day when we are like in a rush yeah to get to an airport okay that is good that is good so let us see how long does it take and also i have i have something on on skye i had like something marked from the previous trip it is like the the end of that long beach lo long long beach where the ferry departs from it says sandy beach which is cool interesting i mean i do not know it is interesting and we and we actually have not checked out this part right i do not think so i think we have not because it was a bit too far out of the way yeah so that is a good call cool i am i am glad about that so it is a short drive actually from the ferry place it is only an hour and a half to the distillery okay so that will be approximately which day i am confused already i know because i do it from the other side so okay now i am thinking from this distillery we will probably be going eastwards to the trossachs yes and maybe do a hike in around glen coe valley you know yes because we need to drive through glen coe yeah so that actually sounds very good huh okay so so i guess the last day could be drive to glen coe hike drive to the trossachs stay there yep okay so which means the distillery could be the day before that and we stay somewhere there and then move to glen coe in the morning yes okay so i am making notes and it will make it clear yes so if they depart on day n this is going to be on day n 2 yes perfect n 2 yeah i need to figure out when they are actually leaving because that is the most the most important bit that we are missing now okay so the previous day we need to finish by being at the distillery and it is probably important for me to check at what times do they do tours yes so again it is scots it is scotland is greenest distillery okay we will be in scotland is green greenest distillery hopefully and the day before that we will just be on skye probably okay monday through friday the last one is at 4 p m okay that is i think that matches yes it is perfect yeah so we want to get there for 4 it takes hour and a half driving however much the ferry is taking do we need to book the ferry or not i will have to check because i do not know yeah okay and it depends on the ferry not all of them are the same yeah so i feel like the rest is like the rest should be pretty easy we just need to figure out what like whether we want to stay longer on skye or in the ullapool area because that is what we are going to explore anyways though right so we will probably have half a day that day on skye  like morning and e early afternoon before we have to take the ferry yes so if that is like a beach day that could be perfect because we do not need that much time to hang out in the beach yeah and i mean i do not like i do not know if we have too much time right because if we need to be there at 4 it is like how much is a drive like an hour maybe an hour yeah an hour plus probably like half an hour to an hour by ferry and all the mails and the queues yeah so like we have the morning and like you know a little bit of yeah yeah yeah one p m 2 p m yeah okay so it could be a nice morning on the sandy beach and if we want to explore more inside that would be the previous day yes yep so that day is something chill in the morning and then driving and then we will need to find something to do after the distillery i mean after the distillery it is like again we we can something to do as in like a pretty place to camp or yeah yeah yeah somewhere for a walk or something interes interesting  but i i think that will be a pretty generally it will be a chill day right how are we doing in time by the way 0 we are like 40 minutes in okay i do not know should we continue the same way just without stopping and then they can cut the recording wherever they want if they want i think so happy with that they wanted more data so i do not i do not i do not envy those people who are going to do transcripts about this project i know tiny tiny scottish places which they really do not know about probably and we probably pronounced it wrong there is that as well absolutely yeah it is going to just be all the placeholders and all over all over the place cool so then we have this day on which we either do something up north and then head to skye in the afternoon and just camp and hang out there in the next morning or we go to skye immediately and then have a day in s skye so i am confused how many days we have the 21st days plan and 2 last days we have 21st days yes and there is one in between but is it one or 2 that is what i do not remember anymore that depends yeah exactly or maybe it is 2 it could be 2 but i think so that is relatively it it is relatively easy to fill 2 days in skye and and ullapool i am sure yeah there is so much in skye so i guess if we if you wanted we could go to even like the distillery in skye or go to raasay yeah if we have 2 days i would say we can also do like talisker probably you know yeah and i do not know hike on skye as well i also think that probably our like hikes sho will have to be adjusted based on the weather and so on because if it rains all day then we cannot go hike obviously that day yeah so i do not know i would actually say let us figure out when when they are departing for sure and like write a preliminary plan that you seem to have noted in  in your notes and then we we check like both of us and maybe them too if there is something particular that we actually want to see either in ullapool or skye  and then yeah okay decide about those 2 last days i am kind of hopeful actually also of the region between ullapool and skye if you look at the map it looks it looks you are kind of you are kind of what i missed hopeful hopeful yeah yeah it looks topologically very interesting yeah we can i mean that is what i am saying like i i do not mean when i say ullapool i mean like the whole west coast you know maybe there is something that we can just see or climb or sleep in it is like this the whole of scotland places to see and climb that is what it is for good okay yeah so i think we have like the the core basically now we just need to i think so too i will send in the link for the car rental and say that i would like to drive yeah and then we can clarify about the last day and plan accordingly so i think you can just like click to request the access to that yes i can sheet and the design and like just create a new one and say like this is this is the actual plan now yeah i will request access i did not yet because i thought there is they were not going to give me access within this conversation span yeah they also it feels like some some stuff listed in the 1st sheet but yeah i do not know like it is just random i feel pretty much in charge yeah we can we can totally be in charge i think they do not mind they are very relaxed good okay as long as we just decided early and like book and so on otherwise my friend will just keep bugging us i see because yeah she is not she is not the kind to wait she seems to be the kind of person yeah who likes to plan she she does not have much time like she all her weekends are pretty much booked so she will not be like flaky about you know x and y i it is very refreshing i have no idea what you are talking

the store 6 spoons of fresh snow peas 5 thick slabs of blue cheese and maybe a snack for her brother bob we also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for for the kids she can scoop these things into 3 red bags and we will go meet her wednesday at the train station okay great speaking about train stations yes where where do you want to spend your summer holiday summer holiday yeah your yeah it is a summer holiday yeah so i i think we will go to the uk right finally yeah yeah to the southwest in cornwall it is a good opportunity to do some sailing actually i think it is historically a place where sailing has been very popular  and it is one of the places where they are still preserving old tall ships actually they have a big tradition yeah the i mean yeah and it is it is quite difficult to find the tall ships in eastern europe for instance so you actually have to travel quite long distances in order to have this sort of experience so that is why i am pretty excited about this holiday i am a little bit afraid about seasickness of the waves yes seasickness and the waves and that windy atmosphere you know yeah but actually i mean the the windy atmosphere should be okay in my experience at least it relaxes you and it takes your mind off of other things which you may usually be worried about such as daily life or whatever  but seasickness the best thing yes yes is to take some pills take them maybe one day before at least and maybe keep taking them if you feel like it but at some point your body will get used to the sea and you will not feel it so bad actually there are people who are kind of hooked on seasickness because it also makes you a bit dreamy and drowsy ah so it is a bit like being high you know so it is a very bad idea to go onshore after this yeah actually there is such a thing as being land sick land sick yeah yeah i i read it in those sailing books  i mean like when we were kids and we were reading about i do not know 0 neill or dickens or something something that i have not done  and they wrote about this yeah because they were they had to get when they were ashore they had to get drunk in order to not get so land sick you know yeah that that is fine i mean i the i have spent a few days at sea and when you come back at least when you go to sleep or you are lying down  i i it feels like everything is moving with you and i i i i am not sure if it is nice or not it is somewhere in between i mean it you kind of like it but at the same time you would like it to stop it is it is a bit weird 0 my god yeah and it goes on for at least one day after you go back one day but i guess i guess you will see you will have your own experience with being land sick land sick yeah i am i am afraid of being seasick yeah you will get over it 1st of all then yeah yeah we will see well hopefully we will have good weather and then it will be easier yeah i did not i did not look on the forecast weather forecast yeah i have not either but i mean i would check it in the week of our yeah yeah of our it is too early when when we leave yeah because otherwise it might change anyway we would be quite close to the coast i guess so it is not such a big risk  the captain can can take some some decisions some courses in order to avoid us being too exposed certain yeah yeah certain winds well it is a sort of introductory trip you know so it should be soft on you so in my mind there are all these images and since from i do not know movies like that one i have watched uhtred you know yeah the yeah the last kingdom kingdom the last kingdom yeah yeah and those viking girls you know sailing the seas yeah but you and i do not i do not know to to what extent viking girls were were sailing the seas i i think they were tending to babies at home rather than sailing actually i have been to a museum in sweden and yeah the great majority did that they were  just women but but there were some warrior girls you know okay and they fought for just like men just like men yeah just like i i imagine them to be very big you know yeah of course in order to have success and not to get killed in your 1st battle yeah i mean they are always big right nordic people 0 my god they are huge they are huge i do not know they i wa i was looking at them like there like i was 5 years old okay yeah and their parents it was strange it is funny yeah it is funny but i i would like to go to some sanctuaries you know to see animals animal yeah but you know sanctuaries actually hold enemies animals who have been saved such as animals who were in a circus or being abused yeah i know yeah and they were reclaimed somehow or maybe captured by the animal police or something like that and put into care of of this kind of sanctuary yeah i know they have some sad stories yeah they do in their lives but yeah i think that is a happy thing now they are yeah of course in a 5 star hotel hotel right now something like that hey do you remember the bear sanctuary we visited yeah yeah the traumatized bears yeah have i told you told you that story about my colleague who went to another bear sa sanctuary  and there was a a girl female bear  that came from the circus  and when i it was the the the customers were brought w with the truck in the sanctuary and they had yeah there wa there was they were not walking on foot huh and when the bear saw the truck she just stood up on her 2 feet and she put her hands you know like in a like in a in a ballet ah okay position and started to do pirouettes you know like in the circus and it was a big huge animal doing so graciously  pirouettes and it was just amazing and the whole crowd of people yeah started to clap their hands and 0 my god scream and the lady from the center is just say no no no we do not distract it you know we want them to be bears not ballerinas yeah it is funny and sad and ugh yeah yeah yeah but you know what is funny when we were little children we actually liked this because we were kind of primed with i mean families everybody around wanted us to go to circus and for applaud when a bear  would be dancing to yeah and all those those tigers i mean it is so humiliating to see such a yeah huge fascinating animal you know yeah lifting his paw  it is silly yeah and i remember the the lady in the ring putting her head inside the mouth of the lion or the tiger super what yeah can i say but and everybody would talk i mean at least in my family that there once was this accident and the animal actually closed his mouth and really i mean i do not know maybe there was maybe there was not but it was something to to bring a bit of suspense too of course yeah the same as as with the acrobats yeah and trapeze the jumps and so on i another colleague of mine told me a story it should be true cause i think there were in the there was in the newspapers at the time i do not know in the 50s or something there was a training lady who that trained all her life lions  and she had those cubs lion cubs and she raised them from cubs to grown ups yeah but there was a rule for for ladies training ladies trainers that they  were not allowed to go in the cage with the lions when they were in at their period you know okay and because of the smell you know of the blood okay yeah and she rosed she raised those cubs s since where they were i do not know like this and they ate her okay they did not ma the staff of the circus did not manage to save her and at least is yeah wild animals yeah that is why i stay away from wild animals yeah even stray dogs so no sorry  stray dogs should not be on the streets yeah they should not be they are cute they are nice but not on the streets yeah but i was thinking to visit that sanctuary with eagles and other huge birds okay yeah sure i mean i i i thought you would be talking about otters but otters i love otters yeah they are so funny yeah i mean i think that the whole thing with otters is that you would catch them sleeping which they do all the time basically  if if if you can catch them while they are active that is fine but otherwise you know they just float as a derelict ship with really no worries and no direction with their tummies up yeah yeah with those but they are spectacular when they are s where when they try and hunt or just play they are yeah amazing i i think their design is amazing because they can float so without any worries i mean they can simply stay like this and the physics do their jobs nature does its job they do not have to worry about anything which is fun yeah you do not even know if they are aware that you are there looking at them they think so i am not sure i did not when i saw them they were just ignoring everybody b because they were the stars of the i do not know zoo or where did you see them in several places but once we were to no actually we were no but i i have seen them in many zoo or gardens in in various cities in europe and it is the same thing almost every time they just stay there float you know weasels on the other hand weasels are much more active but yeah you know weasels are the the the ones which are sort of tubular and long i i know i know but they are on land they do not float yeah they do not float  actually i once saw an otter i think it was in the the czech republic in prague in prague i think and it was sort of putting on a show for the visitors it seemed very aware that people were watching  and it there was this very large water basin where she could float and everything was like this i mean they even had polar bears which had a huge water basin but the whole wall was transparent and you can you could see them floating in the water it and it was spectacular you can imagine a polar bear huge my god swimming under the water i think it is amazing yeah and you know they polar bears in particular have those very big paws yeah like immense paws yeah yeah it is my head yeah doing like this in the water  it was completely yeah it i it is worth s seeing and i was talking about the otters so it kept taking these these dives and showing itself to the visitors but just like proving that she could do it you know she was yeah an actress turning on her sides in the water and it was all a a demonstration you know but you you s i mean you saw them likely in a glass wall yeah exactly like 0 okay an aquarium like an aq an aquarium yeah yeah yeah but a very and at big one 1st i reimagine the the scene from above you know like seeing from a balcony no no that that that was interesting you had them at eye level so you had water actually at eye level you know yeah yeah and the animal would go on land on the piece of land it had there the otter and then it would look at the crowd which was there because it was sort of a star you know and then it would go down again diving and do it is show and then up and again you know watching around  looking around but i th or the crowd was i do not know just being loud happy yeah yeah i mean there were a lot of children so you can imagine ah okay okay i i was thinking that the otter just heard somehow the vibrations you know and she did it on purpose because because she heard that she was she was taking some applause or something yeah i do not know but yeah it seemed to to be enjoying actually the whole situation yeah i know i have an otter life a zoo otter life you know you have fish your meals are secure yeah you just have to have fun yeah yeah the rest of the time yeah it is nice but do you remember i think we went together at that zoo where there was a little window not so little like a meter w wide and a meter  high and sitting with her bag there i think his bag i think it was a he but it was huge gorilla the one staying in the window yeah and she had i do not know some silver hair in her fur his fur yeah and i do not remember the silver hair but i remember the gorilla my god it was huge and yeah taking a look at you by your shoulder 0 my god it was ah ah i do not know if it is a memory a true memory or something that some someone else told me but there was a guy passing by a a an athletic and a viking kind of looking guy and the gorilla get got a little bit mad  or is it i do not know but i i know at some point we were in front of the gorilla area and the alpha male came towards us okay he was exactly like a chief of clan you know yeah coming like this  hey guys what is up  what are you doing here in my territory yeah ah no no no i just i i was confused you told me the story about i do not know sportsmen there yeah yeah that was yeah it was stupid news it was like more like a pr stunt i think about one of the big basketball players or something like that  it could have been shaquille 0 neal actually yeah who was telling that whenever he goes to zoo he he annoys the gorillas because they feel threatened you know that is tough     but actually i in that news they had a zoo manager who was prepared to take a call and he confirmed that gorillas react to shaquille okay yeah which is even more of a sign that it was all directed ah okay maybe yeah do you think so i i guess so but it is okay i mean it they did it well yeah it it is funny it is funny to intimidate a gorilla i think yeah and do you have any idea where do you want to go next af after england yeah actually i do i would like to i mean of course paris would be nice and it is a a good place to sail and all and i would like to do this maybe next year but i would really like to to go in a in a more exotic place such as the southeastern asia maybe thailand or some other country in the area especially if we have enough time to take the trip because you would need i guess 2 days for the return trip you would have to make a stop somewhere i guess in the middle east and then board another plane which takes you to thailand or singapore or whatever and that takes a lot of time but otherwise i think it is completely different from our experience in europe and it is it is worth doing but i do not know i mean that is what i am thinking now that it is warm outside and yeah you know maybe i would just want another kind of warm yes but i might think differently in the cold season 0 so you would like to take this exciting va vacation during i do not know the winter break or something i am not sure usually yeah usually people go to these areas in the cold season  i have once been there in the winter and it was very interesting it was not like going to the tanneries you know where it is still 20 degrees celsius and you can not  can not go into the water so it was complete summer there and so that is a big change and it is nice but we will have to see it also depends on how many leave days i will have because you you need  at least i i would say at least 2 weeks to do this right otherwise it feels rushed because the distance  is long you need a bit of time to accommodate to the place and  i think yeah we would need to take around 2 weeks but yeah it is possible i mean i i would consider this for the winter holiday maybe i think in these these kinds of countries the monkeys are free yeah you know year round i think that will be a great opportunity to i do not know be close to to get yourself by monkeys  no really i would avoid them i mean i i have told you before but i really think monkeys are dangerous especially when there are many of them but fortunately the the areas with monkeys are usually well known and you only go there if you want to  usually you would be surprised by a monkey you know lashing at you yeah i of course if you want to see monkeys we will go there but i will keep a safe distance this time and there were some advices that you do not have to carry any food with you yeah in your backpack but yeah i mean this would be the 1st thing you should not do but even a a bottle of water i used to have a bottle of water when i i went on this hill with monkeys in thailand and they just they wanted the bottle i think it was a small it was a monkey cub at 1st wanted the bottle and i kind of pulled the bottle from its hands which were reaching out towards it aw and you know yeah funny as it might be it was not really you know it did not feel safe actually and then the adults came because you know of course mom and dad i did not behave well to their little one and yeah things started to get a bit tense and i had to leave the area because it was not going to a good area but you left your bottle over there no i did not leave the bottle  it is my bottle your bottle they were stealing everything but i mean usually they would not be aggressive but you do not want to upset them of course i think they i do not think they want water specifically but i think they they wanted the bottle thinking of juice or something i think they have some ex i think they were just curious  i think they were just curious 0 okay just curious for instance they stole somebody is pack of cigarettes it is not like they smoke you know they just  stole the the cigarettes and they took it on a the roof of a kiosk which was nearby okay played with it for a while and then abandoned it there where of course nobody could reach it anymore i think they are too smart for that i think they have a deal with that with the seller from under the yeah the kiosk and if they bring cigarettes or something the s seller would give them food or bananas or something monkey business monkey business yeah but you know in spite of the the good advice of not carrying food you could find a lot of monkey food actually at the bases of this hill okay what is the w what is there yeah talking about i think it was some kind of nuts nuts okay i do not i do not remember exactly yeah monkey food like big a very big bag actually like half a kilo or a kilo okay because there are many yeah exactly because they are many like having a big dog yeah i remember just now that in venice a 100 years ago or something when i 0 you were in venice wow yeah they there were some posts some that you do not have to feed the pigeons you should not yeah there are too many of them yeah bec nah because they damage the sculptures and the buildings and so on ah i see or the but they they were everywhere people sell pigeon food you know yeah and you put it into your arm the food and the pigeons would come into your hand you know and take a photo and have a memory from venice 0 yeah so so how was venice like did you like it i was seasick because we had in venice yeah we took a boat that is an achievement we took a boat yeah to reach venice and i right i of it you came by sea yeah yeah yeah we came by sea i do not know i do not remember i was  a teenager many i do not remember many details but i am sure that we took a boat and i was already sick when we landed and the the the little streets and the canals are so very charming and  you know the museums and the cathedral that is big  actually there was seawater in the cathedral yeah you know and it was it smelled not so but is it really seawater in the channels in in venice yeah i mean it is not it is not sweet water it is the the same as no it is salty huh it is salty because there was that smell that specific smell you know 0 i see and in the church the floor was made of stones you know  and the combination between the smell of the stone and with the salt of the water that was so old  both of them were so old it was and i had that sickness it was   yeah but i what do i remember i remember the statues the pigeons the cafes you know  areas and being sick by the way you were asking about our next holiday maybe we should take a cruise because cruise many many cruise in the mediterranean actually also touch on venice  and it is a good way to to see 4 or 5 destinations in one go that is a good idea but do you think like going on that huge ship that we saw in sweden yeah yeah something like one of those i mean all of them are huge because that is the more effective way to do it it is possible to also take a smaller ship but if you want you know it depends on on your priority if you want to enjoy the sailing  you never have any reason to take a big ship but if you want to enjoy the land destinations then that ship is very good at taking you fast and in comfort to those destination yeah when i see those ships i think of i do not know like agatha christie or something i have my own do you think so with the big cruise ships yes somehow i do not know why it plays in my mind the action from the book in one of those big ships i i know that in those days they would not look like yeah they look now it is impossible because they are so fit you know the the shape of the yeah ship they are too modern and fit  i imagine them to be more more more heavy and scary yeah yeah and i i was i meant in those days huh but i do not know i think of ballrooms you know chandeliers and men in tuxedo in the evening yeah of course although you know i i have never been on on these modern cruise ships but i think they are more like floating malls malls ah no yeah i mean it is it is just like a a big shopping and food courts and of course you also have the entertainment area with swimming pools and whatever so it is a a mix of shopping malls and food courts and entertainment but yeah i do not think they resemble a lot to you know titanic let us say or to death on the nile you make it sounds so romantic so unromantic yeah yeah like a mall like a floating mall yeah whoo i think the purpose of those ships is to make you feel as little as possible like being on a ship actually yeah comparing to i do not know the ships with those big how do you call them no chimneys no no no or what do you mean i do not know of course there are some so different from old ships historical ones but i do not think like they are like floating malls and hotels or well 1st of all they are huge i mean they are bigger than any building on land you should imagine there are between 3 and 5000 people on one of those ships so it is basically a little city it is a town nice and i it is i it usually has 1014 decks okay wow just like the floors of a building yeah and then you most of the time you i mean i said i have not been on a cruise cruise ship i have been but only to cross an area not to spend more nights on that ship so i know what it looks like but i have not spent a lot of time there  and all the spaces are are done exactly like on land it does not have the signature of a a ship is spaces you know which would be more cramped or you know feeling like you are on a ship as you would on a small boat or on a tall ship everything is done in order for you as a as a passenger to feel exactly like on land like for instance the food court which was the whole bridge and it was huge it was i think 200 meters long you barely could see the end of it when you entered the food court my god it was exactly like the old town of a city where you had the main alley and on the sides there were all sorts of restaurants cafes and restaurants yeah you killed the magic what i mean is they have their use but it is not what you would imagine if  if you think about older ships yeah but there is i think in the in the mediterranean sea they have you know like dolphins i think it is worth yeah i think there there are dolphins everywhere i guess in in this area of of  climate so you can see dolphins but so you will see the dolphins from the mall yeah yeah but you you know you would be seeing them from like 50 meters high because the the free deck is very high above the water  it is not like seeing them from a boat or a small ship but i do not think it like seeing them from the top of a of a a block of flats yeah and that is it is strange a little bit but if you have your room and with those round windows yeah you know and you are at the level of the sea you could yeah probably but i i am not sure you want to be there because usually the the worst cabins are at the are there bottom yeah and actually if you if you have a a better category of accommodation it should be higher up actually i think always high always high always is but that that that stayed the same with ti titanic i think i was thinking about titanic a little bit yeah the 3rd class you always have the irish people dancing dancing yeah yeah there was an order over there yeah we should but no i think it it is it is okay i mean the the the thing i like most about these ships is that they are very fast so you go to sleep in venice and you wake up in barcelona and really yeah they that fast yeah wow and they also go more or less in straight lines  on the sea ah because they are so powerful so they do not have to avoid certain no wind certain currents no definitely not yeah they are you know like a big mammoth yeah and but the schedule is like this you get in the morning to your destination you have the whole day or most of it on land and then you board the ship and in the evening or at night it goes to the next destination does not sound so bad yeah spent the night on the sea and you do not enjoy that much the sea that is your point yeah that is my point but i i if you want to do a circuit through through europe it is much more comfortable than a a bus  a coach so yeah yeah it has its advantages of course yeah i think it is nicer and you have the seagulls and the salty air i think there are some advantages i just remembered the a story i had this children is books or teens books i do not know when i was a little child and there were stories i think they were written by russians actually and translated okay and one of them was about this ship i do not remember exactly what was happening there but i remember at one point there was also an illustration of the ship is captain for fun taking his rifle and shooting at seagulls and from that moment on i it stuck in my mind that this is something you do on a ship you know you shoot the seagulls yeah yeah just killing time you know just 0 my god you take a rifle and shoot at seagulls 0 my god those russian authors yeah and th they also have the drawing i imagine you know yes yes it was hand drawn it was very suggestive yeah actually that is the that is the thing the drawings the images yeah actually those books i i had as a little child they would they had very good illustration now that i think of them they were i think they were so different from nowadays because they would use watercolor you know  graphics and pencil graphics and so on now you have that adobe illustrator and they all look the same you know if you put so for me for me because i am another generation with snow white from i do not know yeah 50s from the 50s it is more charming has a lot of you know that specific perfume with that  2 d graphics yeah than those like m mickey mouse club you know  i do not think you know them do you know them who mickey mouse club no no they are so too perfect too you you do not have anything to relate them to but what kind of graphics is it it is made like in adobe in premier  you know in 3 d so is it 3 d yeah it is 3 d it looks more real somehow but it it is  too colorful to be real you know but the kids are born with mickey mouse club and they they do not a and mickey mouse club means all the disney characters yes yes  like minnie mickey i think they have also goofy you know those characters they have donald duck yeah of course it was my favorite yeah it was crazy the way he talk i think i i liked all the i like donald and goofy because you could not understand the the words but you understood them you know i never liked goofy he was too sloppy i dunno it it aargh i like the way he talk yeah he was goofy of course  but donald getting mad that was perfect ah it was a show yeah  yeah you are much better and he got angry ah and do you remember that he had 3 little duck nephews yeah yeah yeah 0 my god yeah it was a full show but yeah yeah that that were that were the funnier and i think there were also these cartoons where it was donald and chip and dale ah they were so yeah 0 my god they were so lovely yeah yes yes i know them chip and dale also that is another  that is another good memory the way they talk i should not i should listen more to to the way they talk you know they squeak they do not talk yeah they yeah i but i am curious how they did the voiceover bec i do not think it it was made on a computer no they could not have it was the 40s it was the 40s i i do not think there was any processing there yeah 0 i see all of these all of these cartoons in our childhood they were actually were propaganda you know most it i mean no yeah no they were not they were they were made in the 40s and if you remember there were a lot about you know fighting there were guns there many times yeah it it was not really about nazis maybe but it was about you know having this fighting attitude i guess  being sort of aggressive which you do not see in later cartoons yeah i mean yeah you have mischievous characters but not that that attitude and you know there is a lot of flag waving yeah you have a few symbols in tom and jerry and in in donald duck as well actually yeah and you know and popeye the sailor he was actually i i think he was a propaganda character he was meant like that i think he was fighting who i mean he was fighting that big guy brown head brown hair guy dark haired guy yeah yeah yeah a huge i dunno in fact yeah but they are saying that was i dunno he symbolized russia or something i do not think so i am i am not sure because at that point it was not russia it was you know everything bad i guess well it was the nazis but russia became a problem later after the war after the war yeah yeah yeah yeah the cold war yeah the the but popeye was actually older i think he came from the 20s or 30s and he worked i do not know i do not know yeah maybe there was a comic book and after yeah i think that is how it started  and the same with su superheroes and with marvel and dc comics  you know th they also came from the 20s and 30s and they had a part of their career was about the war effort more or less fighting the baddies yeah yeah that is and of course we did not treat them like this when we are we are we were small because we we did not get to see the war but it was but it is silly that we have a war right now i mean that is so stupid yeah it is incredible that we just turned back time and you are in the same point somehow yeah it is and it is affecting us because you have inflation and a few other negative effects so it is not a good thing of course yeah yeah just sad plus talking about travel i really wanted to go to saint petersburg which is not longer an option of course but i have heard saint petersburg is a very nice city actually and i think russia has very different areas of course because it is huge it is a huge land mass  but moscow is supposed to be very different from saint petersburg and very different from other russian cities  which probably you would not want to visit but saint petersburg i heard is really nice saint petersburg yeah they have some you know like big cathedrals  orthodox cathr cathedrals yeah and i think they build in a magnificent way because they are not so of course so it was an imperial capital so yeah they are not so humble at the yeah there must be some golden roofs there of course some golden roof some military guys in those shiny uniforms yeah parading and actually you could do saint petersburg and the areas nearby without really traveling throughout russia you could do the baltic the eastern baltic ah so you come up yeah you you you could go through estonia and saint petersburg  and then maybe finland if you want to go through further  north so saint petersburg it is up you know more saint petersburg is in the east north of of the baltic sea from from  estonia you would go a bit north yeah okay north yeah okay moscow is a little bit down you know i think yeah it is it is a lot east and down it is a lot down yeah yeah yeah i think moscow is a nice touristic city i i have heard it is very different from russia i mean from from normal russia normal russia yeah i think i also think they have all the glamour over there and the rest of russia yeah i think it is taking it hard yes i i am sure about that but i think that is the case with many capitals such as berlin yeah not being so german and london not being so representative of england yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah ah i i wanted to say something about moscow but i forgot i heard it is pretty expensive really i mean by russian standards at least i do not think it is as expensive as the nordic countries for instance or as london but yeah i i guess like any big city  it is it is it is different from from the prices you would find in the rest of the country i heard that it is very cold i i am not so sure maybe it is because it is continental okay and maybe it is it is drier actually i think because there is a lot of land around it your butt freezes in 2 seconds come on do you remember your friend from sweden that lived in moscow some years and he  thought that he would not have any problem with the cold in winter because he is from sweden yeah he had a big surprise yeah maybe maybe in sweden it is milder because it is wet i dunno because i think it is different sea cold from the continental yeah cold yeah probably i think it is quite different by the way when i was in in thailand and in singapore it felt like you were in a sauna or in a washing machine after you turned it i know because it there was so much water in the air it was saturated really it was very hot but at the same time very wet it was like jungle  feeling it was very strange and there was a very particular smell as well it is somehow pleasant like it was i think i think it was natural i do not think it was a city smell 0 but it smelled like what like sea or like leaves yeah i i think it was something vegetal and wet  everything was wet the soup was wet i imagine yeah soup too you you were talking about thailand or singapore mostly singapore but it also okay applies to thailand yeah okay yeah lots of memories but i saw some pictures with you and with the tiger cub yeah from the from there yeah tho those were from thailand i think yeah i will never be sure if those tigers were had a good life or maybe they received some sort of a drug in order to be so calm and because there were lots of people there i think there were over 100 tourists and they kept coming and going and everybody was was petting them  and it is not very cat like you know to to be so still and  you know let everybody touch you  especially if you are a tiger i guess  so they did not seem to be abused in every way in any way they looked very nice their fur was perfect  but i just wonder if it is possible for a tiger to behave like this natural i get you silly cats you know made of textile yeah so i guess you would like to to have this experience anyway of course of of of being with the tiger cub yes i would love to squish a tiger cub i think they are so you know even the little ones are like dog size they are pretty big and the cubs yeah of course yeah of course you know like a big dog not like yeah of course they are you know felines big stuff yeah yeah big cats big cats that is the name for them yeah  i think in 5 minutes we should be okay yeah so that was about our future vacations and yeah yeah it is always a nice a nice topic to to talk about it is lovely so especially now that it is warm outside it it really feels like going on a holiday yeah have a martini and go on a holiday yeah although it is pretty rainy here a and it is good i i expected it to be mu much hotter by by this time sticky too sunny too sticky yeah exactly but no no it is okay it is okay i think this rainy weather would would last a little bit more and then we have our furnace like usual like usual yes like usually and then when the furnace come we should go to 25 degrees in england yes 25 am i yes it is a good plan that is a i i think so yeah but the water is pretty pretty cold so i i am sorry for you but i do not think you will be able to swim in in the sea it is okay i do not want to swim in the ocean without knowing with the dolphins to swim yeah i i went once in i i did not go you know in an ocean but in i dunno i think it was the mediterranean  but i did not get the balls to go without the life saving jacket huh because the we the water was so deep and the guy you know the captain of that little little boat who took us  deep in the sea told us 0 there are i do not know 100s of meters of of deep eh deep waters yes yes and you know you cannot see the shore because we are in you know like in a volcano area you know like in a scoops yeah well area of the it does not matter so much if it is over 2 meters yeah it is the same 2 or 100s you can drown happily yeah but i do the same actually even even when sailing at when we were at anchored or in a bay  i always had my life jacket with me that is safe i mean not not really always the only the only way i would not go with a life jacket was if i had my my snorkeling mask on yeah because i it it bothers you if you also have a life jacket it kind of floats you up and you can not 0 yes you can not go a bit down to keep to look at the your head fish or yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah and that was really nice actually because the water was very clear in those areas it it was increased and you could swim around the boat and also inspect it is it is keel and the anchor chain and so also like a safety check besides just you know looking at the nature yeah but mediterranean is not so salty is it i mean it is actually it kept you up yeah yeah yeah it does huh it keeps up and if you have that mask it does not matter so much anyway because as long as the tube is above water you are fine and yeah i know actually i if you are in the bay there are too big waves and the tube should have a a mechanism which does not water it does not let water get in yeah it blows it out yeah i i saw it i i think it closes it if if there is any water ah yeah and then you can blow it outside yeah yeah yeah i love snorkeling it is such it is such a sensation of seeing the the little colored fishes yeah fish yeah but the sensation of freedom i think it is  it is great it is yes and and i have this sensation in the balloon in the air  balloon yeah yeah but it is different it is different it is not the same but eh it is a sense of you know  letting go yeah it feels very nice i i really hope you will feel like this with sailing as well because it is not so far from being in a balloon it is just longer and it gets easy  but otherwise it is pretty similar and it is not so long and you know where you land you know you know the port is fixed and yeah tha that is that is a very important advantage yes you have more control you have more control yeah yeah yeah yeah but the the ship that we will travel with 0 on does it have a you know like motor or only yes i i i am not sure actually but i guess it does because i am not even sure they would be allowed to sail without an engine nowadays huh huh huh so u usually even the old tall ships they have been equipped with engines but many of them were used for commercial activities such as fishing or transport  and and they have been equipped a long time ago with  engines  or even built with them so yeah i am pretty sure it is also the fact that without an engine it would need a tugboat or some assistance every time it moves or it has to to stop in a port  so that is an additional cost and so i i guess it makes sense for them to to have an engine of course no i think it is s safer you know yeah definitely because there is now there is the wind there is the wave yes yes you know in the old days a ship might have to just wait for weeks if it did not if if did not have the the right wind the right weather yeah to yeah that that was very dangerous for the crew as well and they had to stay on they could not i do not know like they go to sleep like the boat the yes they could do that they could try to pull the the ship with row row boats 0 okay but this is not something you can do for a long time  i mean i it is it is very slow and very tiring for the crew to do this  so you might do it if it is an emergency or some special situation but i do not think you can do it for days on end to compensate for the lack of wind  and what actually yeah happens if you have the bad wind and currents is that you might go very far from your course or even go back ooh yeah that is not good and in that case it does not help so much to use the row boats to to pull the ship it sounds so difficult yeah it is everything sound so difficult sailing used to be very much or season dependent i mean you would use yeah a certain boat depending on on the season you are in  you would not be able to leave across the atlantic maybe unless it was spring and come back in the autumn  when the wind that is the trade winds actually ah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah i have heard of that when they traded i do not know they bought stuff from the colonies in america and those 13 colonies yeah and they i do not know took the indian furs yeah and they have to wait for the right season to do yeah yeah yeah those traveling yeah i have heard of that okay are we done so see you on vacation yeah yeah see you of course thank you i cannot wait thanks bye yeah bye (EDACC-C30-00)

brother bob we also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids she can scoop these things into 3 red bags and we will go meet her wednesday at the train station hello my participant number is id f c 25 p one please call stella ask her to bring these things with her from the store 6 spoons of fresh snow peas 5 thick slabs of blue cheese and maybe a snack for her brother bob we also need a plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids she can scoop these things into 3 bags 3 red bags and we will go and meet her wednesday at the train station okay good so we are done with the 1st part right  should i start asking some questions or yeah hit me okay okay i wanted to talk about friendship 1st the 1st question i have is do you prefer to have many friends or just a few that you are close to for me i think a few i am close with honestly i think having having acquaintances and people being familiar with people is one separate thing but what i deem friendship is so i am close and i can be kind of be vulnerable with and open up to so definitely on a i would say a close amount  how about yourself and why 0 i think just by my nature being more like sec like a secluded kind of person yeah i am not too extroverted  it is not like i am shy yeah but i just pr prefer having a few close friends yeah i like having acquaintances and being friendly even if i do not know people like i like to say hi yeah nice or start a conversation but not get too close with most people but just a few so yeah yeah i think again i think understanding understanding that you do not need to open up to everyone and the few people that you do open up to and you decide to open to is still a big thing so regardless you have like a small amount or a big amount of friends it is important to have friends where we can open up i think that is the the big thing we need to really focus on when when we think about relationships and friendship it is like asking yourself am i okay to open up is this actual friendship was this something what i think is a friendship but really it is just you know me just me just going around to loads of people being like hey what is up what is up look i have so many friends yeah you know is that yeah but i do not think there is just one like way to have a close friend like closeness is different for different people cause with my close friends or who i think are my close friends yeah i do not really really even need to talk to them too much it is more kind of like one of those things where we meet a few times a year have a good conversation yeah and then we like live in different countries and everything we do not really but yeah yeah but that is what i am trying to say it is like i guess the different there is different like layers to it of like what if like how close you can be to a friend for me when i say close friend  i mean someone genuinely like i can open up with i am talking to maybe not most all the time but i can you know like yeah that level of reliance but this is someone which i can be vulnerable with you know and okay i think yeah that is what i think that is i mean but not everybody is like that though cause you know yeah yeah cause not everybo cause not everybody can be even vulnerable to themselves you know some people are very repressive so it is it is like i guess it is it is different for each for me that is it is this case for me yeah i think everyone has their idea of what being close to someone is yeah i do not know if you remember but i told you about that story of those 2 friends of mine that kind of stopped speaking because one of them felt like the other one was not yeah putting enough work into it while the other yeah one was just thinking that they were just doing enough cause their yeah ideas of clo closeness should be yeah like was different so yeah yeah it is completely different yeah yeah i have a question as well go for it when you were when you were a kid what kind of games did you play that is a long story i was a i was a kid a long time it is okay let me let me think summarize it just summarizing like just give a k a few just give me like a few because of my brothers i played mostly like what is considered boys games so i played counter strike gta shooting games need for speed i think i played barbie games on my own but because yeah they were like competitive into shooting i did a lot of yeah counter strike so yeah did you ever have storylines did you have storylines with your barbies no memorable stories i remember playing a barbie dress up game where they would go on a runway after and i  actually remember having so much fun with it and i tried to look it up recently and i just could not yeah find the exact game cause there is so many yeah barbie games yeah i wish i could i feel like that would bring so many memories for me yeah yeah yeah but yeah i think a lot of counter strike for sure what did you enjoy about those games i think gta i did not really know how to play it i just went around right yeah but that is the whole fun of it you just do not really know it you just roaming around like free yeah but there is missions in gta so yeah it is a really nice story too as well about you i do not know the story yeah i would just play like stealing cars and everything i think i enjoyed counter strike the most because of the social aspect of it cause you could chat with people and also yeah get to know people a lot of people from my town would play so it was a way that is nice of meeting someone that was nice yeah what about you what what games did you play i think you have a bigger history of gaming 0 yeah no with like with game yeah 100% but if i had to really boil it down let us say around the era where i played on my 1st console which was a p s 2 i think there is i have 1000s of games but the ones that i probably deem probably most memorable and like my probably definitely the top top ones i enjoyed so much is definitely gta gta san andreas was so fun  although although i was a kid you know it is not it is not a game for a kid it was just like having the freedom to roam around and do these kind of cool story missions and like actually involve it was not the most immer i do not know it was immersive for its time i guess but it was not crazy immersive but it was a nice storyline it was a very mature storyline but i still f found it very cool and it just had the whole fantasy of like being being being this reckless you know crazy protagonist protagonist antagonist antagonist yeah definitely antagonist probably antagonist that is true but another fond memory i have of a game is this one computer game i played on the laptop and it was like called poptropica something like that and you are like little like like basically like cartoon characters and you jump about and it was like a cool little story it is like everything is in the 2 d it is all on 2 d so everything is flat 2 d so it was it was really cool it was fun it was just i had a lot of childhood memories on it i used to play with it played on it with my with my childhood friend and it was just really cool and i think i liked that again because it had like a cartoony kind of playful feeling to it and it was really nice and fun those are 2 did you ever did you ever play papa is pizz pizzeria or no no no i just had no no every couple of years of my childhood and even probably adult years i would start playing it for fun and then i would get addicted cause you want to expand more and more and more yeah that was yeah one of the online games i think i played a lot of s like mini games like not the ones that you yeah have to download and stuff but just find yeah yeah something online yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah for sure that reminds me i think the major most major game definitely has to be roblox now think about it yeah yeah yeah yeah i was going to say i think yeah roblox i think cause when i when i entered there 1st we would almost 10 years ago now it was like 2011 wow i played so it is already been 10 years ago when i played for the 1st time it was amazing it was like the social hub for all the kids it was creative they had like a currency system you have material things before you went before you saturate you know and the market nowadays for like games like you have to buy a v box and things like that and like packs and skins and things like that it was like the come up of like getting into that material materialization of like of of fun games but that was fun that was great i had i used to roleplay on it it was an awesome game role playing like dungeons like dragons nights going from star wars role playing it was just like it was just fun and it was really creative roleplaying is very creative in a sense because again you get to have such cool dialog create narratives and it is awesome so that was definitely one of my favorite games what games do you play now games i play now games i play now is simply i play valorant which is a a 1st person shooter which is a tactical game is is it is valorant a roleplay game valiant is not a roleplay no what is a roleplay game then from i can give you my perspective on it but if you want to clear on i am sure now google always has the answer but for me what i what i deem as an rp game a role play game which is rpg is something that has a kind of lore or aspect of it where you can how do i describe it has it definitely has a deeper context and lore and you are brought into you are brought into something which is like a storyline or you are brought into an environment where there is already lore and there is something to it okay okay okay okay okay okay okay but i think the main aspect of roleplay games is that usually there is there is a there is like a cri no not criteria but there is like info on like attack points things like that damage points it is it is just more detailed of like what you do and there is more aspects of like storyline and developing a story yeah yeah yeah there is attack points and things like that you know and it is interesting because most of the roleplay games they invite you to be immersed in this whole new environment and they want you to be to be kind of like immersed in this character you create for example i roleplay games that i know of like skyrim they bring you they they allow you to create your character and is not brought into just like a you know a a prebuilt character but there is there is okay okay there is roleplay games like witcher witcher is like a popular roleplay game as well where you are born into a character yeah but as you know there is attack points or storylines there is dialog you are immersed there is definitely more immersion in a roleplay game that is it okay got you yeah did you every play a roleplay game i am not sure did i ever world of warcraft no is that a roleplay game no i have not played that yeah it is a roleplay i played i can not remember if i have ever played a roleplay game i do not think so right now i am just playing stardew valley which is a farming game yeah which i love a lot it is kind of addictive as well i see yeah  i think stardew valley might be a roleplay game i do not think so because you know yeah it is really it is yeah stardew valley is a simulation roleplaying game developed by yeah that is so confusing to me because from what you just explained i assume yeah that roleplaying means you get to meet other characters you get to like say things like choose what you want to say but i guess you can do that in stardew yeah i mean that is in stardew yeah it has all the aspects 0 okay okay okay okay it has all the aspects i thought it was just a farming game no okay because you are brought into a role you are brought into a role of of this character you create the creation is there most roleplaying game have creations where you okay okay 0 okay okay okay okay okay okay so you play that role or something so by creating your character you are in a roleplay game yeah but for valorant yes because the characters are premade it is not roleplay they are premade and there is okay there is no like storyline to follow or there is no like quests and things like that roleplay games typically have quests okay okay they have these like like a linear narrative i i would say valorant does not really have valorant does not have like a li linear storyline it has like a linear gameplay of like you have to beat the enemy team and it is like you know it is like counter strike counter strike is not a roleplay game okay i got it i understand yeah it is just yeah yeah yeah so yeah do you want me to ask do you want to ask me anything okay i will ask you something okay w what do people do during movies that really annoys you at the cinema  or at the movie theater okay i am going to be honest i am going to be honest everything that people have done that is annoying during movies is something which i have done myself so i can never really get too annoyed 0 could get too annoyed right do not tell me you were one of those people who take the picture of the movie with flash on no no no no no no it was always okay because that would be that is the most it was always flash off it was always flash off okay i would never do flash on that is just like insane that is entirely insane because you have just you have that is like 0 social awareness because you do not really know what is going on that is that is the one i find the most annoying is when someone yeah i know yeah i i just do not understand the proc process for me because the flash does not even help cause you cannot yeah take a good photo for me for me it is just like speaking to yourself while watching the movie or like you know to yourself yeah yeah yeah a lot of people do that when they watch the movie they go like 0 my god this is like this or this this and this it is like 0 they are probably 0 no you can not be doing this you know things like that commenting out loud for the other person who is with them not just talking with themselves right not necessarily some people just do it themselves and okay okay okay okay and regardless it is like speaking during a movie it is a bit annoying because it is like i i know what is happening on the screen i do not really need you to commentate you know and yeah i think that that and that is pretty much it really i think that is it now everything else i do not really mind i like i do not mind laughing because i like laughing during movies even if it is like a serious movie for me i just really find it annoying if someone is speaking or taking photos with flash on or the one thing that you can not really do anything about it but when someone is crunching a lot with their chips bag or whatever yeah it is you know yeah i do not know i mean that is why i am very self conscious when i i mean i am always so self conscious cause in place that i am really worrying but but no i say i am conscious when i when i like bring out like a chips bag or like i am munching on popcorn or like i am bringing out like my food i do it very slowly because i do not want to annoy you you know i do not want to yeah because you i mean yeah that is you know it is like to crunch once it is it is whatever right yeah you have to open the bag but to just constantly be crunching on i do not know yeah i know yeah i know many people like my friends you know ydolf he he he he eats food slowly like me we eat like we crunch on it slowly because i say it does not make too much noise yeah i would say that i would enjoy watching movies by myself at home more than i do at the movie theater just because of other people like yeah i do not really enjoy to sh like sharing the screen with everyone i think i think yeah i see that is i think movies are supposed to be in a big screen yeah yes movies are for big screen but for me i want to be by myself and enjoy it fully and not worry but what are you are you worrying about people like making noises i just do not like i do not know i guess i like to talk to myself when i am home watching a movie okay okay so in the in the movie theater i can not do that yeah so what what do you usually say you say i do not know i just comment on it is good yeah there is yeah i know you because i know but i i i i have never done that in a movie theater i just do it when i am by myself yeah i go like 0 you no way she did that or i cheer for a character or i get really sad yeah i did that i did that recently i did that recent because i just feel free to do it yeah yeah yeah yeah you are right you are completely right i did that i did that yesterday and it was stranger things 0 okay and i was and and i have never usually done that i have never usually do that unless it is like a really good scene and i was just screaming like go run run run and i was just clapping i was just clapping and really loud and i think i think you are completely right but i have done that in the cinema as well like me and my friends we have done that we have got like really hyped of this scene which is 0 yeah everyone everyone was it because everyone did or was it just because you were yeah we usually usually everyone everyone everyone okay okay okay so for for example like you know spider man you know when the people come when they appear those 3 geezers  we just made the you know we we make some noise and you know we get a bit hyped it was really fun spoiler alert okay spoiler alert really okay fair enough fair enough 0 yeah very fun but i think it was certain movies the sound design the atmosphere is made for a cinema example is lighthouse i think batman also was made the cinema the sound effects the music just everything sound design nee needs to be experienced i think in the big screen at least once i guess that is fair yeah i guess just for some but then again if you got a really good pair of headphones then go for it i think i am put off from watching movies in the movie theaters because firstly tickets here are super pricey yeah and also in my hometown i there is like no movies yeah yeah there is just yeah i can not get there yeah yeah yeah so i would have to travel 2 hours to get to a movie theater right all right i mean that is more than fair enough i would rather like if i were you i would invest in maybe i do not know i i guess i i i feel like projector rooms i do not need i i do not even need to inve 0 a projector tha that is a cool experience i think that is cool yeah a proje that is but i do not if i i guess get a good projector rather than the cheap one because i guess the right the quality will be a bit grainy but i think just get a good pair of headphones and see how the experience changes or watch on the tv at least you know yeah that is fair but good pair of headphones can turn the sou the sou like the movies are sensory right so it is what you you know what you digest with the what you digest with the eyes and then what you hear you know because you can not taste or touch a movie yeah i mean the quiet place have you seen the 1st part you have right 0 yeah yeah i have seen the 1st part that that you can not experience well on a computer or a laptop  because it is all about the sound and the surround so yeah that is something that i had to go to the movies for yeah because i was just like there is no way that this could work on a yeah yeah and i am glad i did because it was all about the sound and the music so yeah that one is that one is different though did you watch did you watch in cinema yeah 0 i watched the 2nd part at home but yeah yeah cause i knew the 2nd part was not going to be as good so i did not want to bother yeah but the 1st part is this the one that when i see yeah john krasinski it is it is funny how i did not you know because i did not watch office before but i would seen that is the 1st time i have pretty much seen john krasinski yeah krasinski or kranskinski krasinski i do not know which one or how you pronounce it but one of them i do not know and then yeah it is just weird to think 0 wait that is the girl from you know office yeah for me it was so weird to see him in a serious role cause i only knew him as jim from the office and i was like yeah there is i i do not know but he is good he is good he is good he is good  it is nice to him as serious yeah i have got another question go for it did you have a favorite book or film or tv show do i or did i did you as a child okay okay as a child and what was it all about 0 that is a great question i think my favorite book was the diary of anne frank do you know much about it i know the premise of it and i know the yeah i know the premise so okay i think i must have read that book as a kid at least like 4 or 5 times 0 yeah firstly cause i just loved ki kind of like diary type of novels or books or whatever i could get my hands off on that seemed like a diary i loved to read it cause i was like i just want to know people is intimate thoughts that they are willing to share that i can read yeah yeah but the 2nd thing is obviously how tragic her destiny was that was also compelling i do not know i just kinda connected with that book it must be because i was the same age as she was when she was writing it like 1213 okay right so i think that was my favorite book and definitely influenced a lot of i think my look at how i look at life my favorite movie yeah as a kid must have been truman show and i think that movie made me paranoid as a lot of people did become paranoid because of it cause it i ever since i watched it i every now and again i just think you think about someone is watching me yeah yes i think but i so i do not think i think the whole premise of it was to like kinda indict that thought but not necessarily thinking like 0 someone is watching you but to think to make you think is what we see before us like really reality and have we just accepted it yeah i know it is and and and i think it did develop very literal number on my psyche yeah i can imagine cause i think that did for as well and what was the 3rd thing except for you asked for a movie tv show tv show as a child probably 0 there was a lot of them i watched yeah so many tv shows there was a channel called fox life where they played a lot of sitcoms and i would watch them so much my brothers would call me a couch potato and they said even when i turned 30 i am going to be still watching fox life from my couch yeah cause i just i did it so much that is probably how i learned english as well that is good yeah but i would say the 1st one that i thought of was medium do you know what medium medium no what is it about what is it all about it stars this it stars a great actress i do not know if you know her her name is patricia arquette and she is basically someone who can kind of speak to ghosts but in a very like believable way in her dreams and telepathic kind of thing it is more it is more psychological than sci fi but it is okay sci fi obviously okay yeah but it is so so good so good she is such a good actress yeah i love that show all right all right yeah yeah those are my favorites what were yours nice my favorite book honestly i did not read much books as a kid if i had to be honest and briefly honest i have a hard time reading story books i love fiction contemplative yeah fiction i love non fiction i love philosophical books i like spiritual books contemplative books anything that makes me think and digest it and you know actually like resonate or meditate on it i like that stuff 0 stories not so much so if i had to say probably one as a kid diary of the wimpy kid which is i have never read that i think i wanted to though yeah it is like a childhood thing like every every every child from like kinda the era like kind of yeah that that that decade or era kind of read it it was like the hype and i think i have fond memories of reading it cause i guess the kids in it were quite similar to the age i was so it was just really interesting and yeah nothing crazy it was just fun it was just like you know really kiddie like little adventure things like you know i think it was one where they had to go on a holiday together and it was just interesting and the drawings were just you know they are cheap and not cheap i would say but very cartoony and it is just nice just nice  my favorite film as a kid 0 i watched a lot of adult movies as a kid adult yeah or like for grownups grownups grownups grownups grownups grownups like i would say like mature movies like i watch yeah yeah yeah okay okay i watch scarface you know 0 god with al pacino i watched that when i was like 11 or 10 or 12 and i would imitate and i would i would no i would say probably around 111110 and i would imitate scarface and i would you know i would want to you know role model and glamorize it at school and things like that but i and i watched i think it was godfather around then as well but i watch i was watching like things like friday the 13th for such a young age and i was i was into like slasher movies like 0 i was into like i was really obsessed with jason voorhees for some reason who jason voorhees friday the 13th you know the guy with the hockey mask jason voorhee 0 yes yes yes from friday the 13th that series the slasher series i was just really obsessed with 0 my god and i do not i think i guess it was it was a bit like i was watching things like alien vs predator and i really was obsessed with predator and things like that just all these like you know mature movies so if i have to say a favorite film which i watched over and over again i think i have a strong attachment or liking of simple and beautiful spider man 2 sam raimi is 2004 spider man 2 it had all the trips a kid could not understand but could appreciate for sure like things okay like love things like a really cool villain a broken villain who was a had a decent kind of story at the beginning and an introduction of like you know this guy is really cool and then becomes a octopus killer guy but it was just awesome from the soundtrack from who is the who did the soundtrack for sam raimi is it was he still does music now  who is it you know who did the spider man 2 no i do not let me look it up really big guy really big really big famous the name were jay robert harris paul francis webster no no no no not harris no no no no no spider man danny elfman there you go okay i have never heard of that person danny elfman you have never heard of danny elfman no he did the he did the score for the original batman he did the score for beetlejuice tim burtons he did the score for doctor strange in the multiverse of madness he did the soundtrack for charlie and the chocolate factory he did ed edward scissorhands he did alice in wonderland apparently 50 shades of gray men in black 0 my goodness  you want to know something funny what i was going to 0 take a look at 50 shades of gray and i could not get past the 1st 2 minutes it was so cringey yeah the acting is so weird the script the the dialog it is just it seems like a child wrote that i do not yeah i i just could not yeah i can imagine but yeah all right so i mean i was going to pick yeah spider man 2 and my favorite tv showcartoon 0 let us go with tv show tv show just a i did not watch any t i did not watch tv shows so i am going to go to the cartoon i think okay okay okay okay okay i am going to go with 0 spongebob 0 it is a tough one it is out to spongebob or ed edd n eddy and it is a tough one ed edd n but you ed edd n eddy did not watch a single tv show like lost or anything like that as a kid no not really like no i was more into like family guy and south park i think south park damn it is tough it is tough cause it is interesting cause most of my humor is based on that you know like south park and south park and spongebob pretty much that is all it is like that is accumulation that is such a weird mix cause one of them is such innocent humor and the other one is dirty and vulgar yeah and and i think that i mean that describes me well does not it i do not know that is think about it i think you just like memes that no one understands i did before now i just love anything like organic memes being like things like situations in my life and then a lot like spongebob situations honestly and south park situations but if i had to pick 10 it is tough i am going to go with south park because i have the most fond memories of binging all the south park episodes i played world of warcraft because of south park cause that one episode so i am going to go with south park it was just funny it was just ahead ahead of its time it was satire to like kinda re real life situations and really made into satire and it was awesome awesome  yeah okay what is your next question me it is my turn are you very motivated to do things or do you kind of need to wait for motivation to strike you see i think i am going to question your question no i am not going to question your question i am going to say you can no it is it is okay no what i am what i am going to say i think you need to be more sp specific it is like well am i motivated to do things or what yeah just everyday things whether they are big projects or just like a shower or anything do you feel like you are mostly unmotivated or like generally a motivated person i think general i think general like jumps the gun i think genuinely motivated but they are they are definitely phases where i can not be asked to do anything and i am very become very lazy it is a mix really it is a spectrum and it is a mix for me but hey for the most part like if i need to brush my teeth i need to do something sometimes i do not do them i can not be asked but most for the most part if i say i need to do something i usually do it yeah but now what chores that people give you like things that people want you to do for them yeah yeah yeah like for school do you feel motivated right away yeah yeah but that is different it depends if like who people who are these people you know it is like it is different for everyone it is different for everyone family and friends family and friends and school is completely different cause it depends on if you are invested in school or not for me for me yeah i can do everything family want me to do it is so cool sometimes i am forgetful and usually i am forgetful but it does not mean that i will not do it if you remind me i will do it i am motivated to do it school i am motivated to do the things that which i enjoy and things that i am not really got got much interest or passionate about then i have a hard time getting motivated about but you can see how it is all different across the board there is no like one general like motivation it is kind of mixed really for me okay fair enough how about yourself i think my motivation depends a lot of my on my physical well being because when you are like a bit anemic like i am you are just like life energy gets sucked out of you yeah and you are not like the psychological motivation is not even in question cause i just need to lay in bed but i do not think i have described myself as lazy sometimes i just need to say okay i can not do these things today and that is it i guess i do procrastinate on work quite a bit yeah obviously cause that is really yeah definitely procrastination procrastination but always do it on time somehow yeah i guess you just say you are motivated that when you are at the last straw yeah i guess my motivation is like the same as me it depends on free will like if i feel like i need to do something or i have to do it i put it off but if something is by my free will yeah then i do it faster and i am mo more motivated yeah cause it comes from a place i do not know it does not come from a place of forcing  yeah yeah it is awesome i love them to do okay my question is do you believe there is anything after death 0 i it is such a loaded question it is simple one i guess i do not know no it is not no it is not no it is not for me personally okay what do you think what do you think wha i i do not think what do you yeah i do not think that there is such know for sure right huh i said obviously you do not know for sure because no one knows what happens after death but no no no everyone has an opinion on on it i personally do not think that there is anything such as like wha like reincarnation or heaven or hell like all those things are such c co like such material concepts that were just like that is what we can think of with our limited human capacity to think i think whatever comes after you die with your consciousness is something that the human brain cannot comprehend and therefore huh it cannot be put in terms of words or even something that we can imagine right it is just something way beyond fair i think what happens with the body is clear but right yeah what happens with the consciousness that is something that we can not comprehend and therefore i can only dream or imagine about it but i can not really i can not really yeah buy the idea that i come back as something or that i  move on to like this heaven or hell i i do not know okay yeah yeah i think some sort of energy that is left behind me even if it is like a physical sense of energy or yeah whatever that can transform into other things material even even or even yeah yeah other people so in that sense it could be similar to reincarnation but yeah yeah yeah that is interesting yeah okay what about you i think you i think you are definitely i think i had a i think i 100% agree with it it is something we can not fathom glimpses of and touch but i think we need to understand that there has been people that have been far ahead and they have been under they have felt and i have experienced the unfathomable unfathomable and they have kind of like you know they gave into the dialects but again that is just things like we have been told and it is like some things like things like heaven all this heaven and hell and things like yeah it is projections of like you know different states of whatever this and this and this i just think for me for for me for me personally for me personally like i am basing my experience and feeling it feels like okay this is like i would like to believe like there is i do not know even is not even a form of liking it is like well whatever happens happens but i definitely think there is there there is there is reincarnation for no reason there could be possibly reincarnation but there is something it is something there is definitely different higher planes of existence and like reality and things like that which we can definitely transcend but there definitely is not just the end of because i do not think there is the end of anything i think there is a very there is a continuation of like a a stream of consciousness going somewhere else then plus with us going somewhere else because it always is somewhere like it is always constant it is it is always somewhere it is always somewhere or someplace but i i do believe i do believe there is like a thought of of reincarnation again this is just a thought but i think a lot of people have tapped into understanding understanding okay a more deeper understanding of life and that i think that ranges from people i think when i was reading this book recently it is talking about how if you you know people have a past regression like you know people can learn about their past lives you know and when they when they learn about their past lives and things like that they usually do not like it because it reminds them that you know they have they have been through a lot of things over and over again which i think you know it makes me feel as if like we have been we we have done a lot of things in life especially in this existence on this plane we have done a lot of things a lot a lot of things and i think it feels almost it feels more like we will reincarnate again and again and again maybe not again and again and again but maybe reincarnate in different form but there is definitely a stream of consciousness when we move into some other plane i think okay that is fair well we need to start another meeting so because this one is out of time so has this fully ended no it has not yet but it will in a minute but yeah i will just send you an invite again okay yeah because a 40 minute limit and unless you upgrade so i will just send you okay

hello hello hi hi start this recording or this meeting i will start by stating my id my id is f c 28 dash p one and my id is f c 28 dash p 2 that is great thanks so i guess at the beginning we are going to read the small package let me check it a small passage yeah okay yeah so i will start saying this package 1st okay i will go ahead now please call okay stella ask her to bring these things with her from the store 6 spoons of fresh snow be peas 5 thick slabs of blue cheese and maybe a snack of her brother bob we also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids she can scoop these things into 3 red bags and we will go meet her wednesday at the train station okay perfect so my turn now please call stella ask her to bring these things with her from the store 6 spoons of fresh snow peas 5 thick slabs of blue cheese and maybe a snack for her brother bob we also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids she can scoop these things into 3 red bags and we will go meet her wednesday at the train station that is great my friend so i think the next thing is to answer these questions listed here so what about choosing the 1st question 1st yeah sure yeah what what do you think about would you like to start yeah the one i will talk about now that is when you were a kid what kinds of games did you use to play is there any is there what is there one you remember well yeah that is of course i believe that is like a really nice question because like old days and still and up until now i am still like gaming i like like i love gaming i am really into gaming so i still play a lot of games and gaming especially made me happy in general and gave a lot of feelings it was really good to me like it it is the best sort of escapism like you are in a different world and you are trying to chase different things  yeah and i love this sort of because like the normal life sounds to be a bit boring at the time but so yeah one game i remember remember i think cause you have played with me you used to play with me league league of legends do you know this game yes of course i do i mean we spend most of our free time playing this game yeah even in our busy time we used to skip things to play the game and yeah the years ago this game was a lot different than now but however like what so let us start by telling tell me please what like what did you like the most about the game and why did you choose it in particular to be in this game so basically i it is just because i like competitive games and i mean league of legends is one of the mist most famous games in this category and also i like communicating with other people so and it does have a chat of course yeah it is not the most friendly one but yeah of course the community i mean it does the job yeah yeah and you know there there is a variety of cham champions we have it has like around a 150 champions so you know you do not get bored that easily because there is always a new champion to try exactly lately  there are like 160 something like that yeah they are they are a lot yeah and you yeah you get to to try new strategies and you know like a 160 champions even if you pay one champion there are so many combinations depending on your team picks and so on so i mean yeah you get to try a lot of different things and what about you yeah well okay let honestly there is a lot to talk about 1st all 1st of all the thing that is all these characters or the champions they have their own background story they have like and i love these stories yeah i love this word like the like the panthers yeah and these like the ones that are far different from the rea reality so when you like read about a champion and their backstory you i get attached to it and i feel like i am this champion like by yeah myself personally for example there is like 2 champions that i love i used to love the most of course remember there is one of the champion and he is like a a ninja that controls shadows and stuff so i have been like thinking and imagining being a ninja who can like throw sugarcane at enemies and even in the real life i i used to like mix between reality and imagining the game so i used to be like literally any character i talk like that i move like that i do a lot of stuff like i am in the personality i tried to get into character as well as yeah twisted fate like like we can in a 2nd alter the reality and enter into the the body of the other champion that is twisted fate and i start to talking like him moving or behaving like him my attitude and everything and plus if they used to play with cards so i bought cards here from the store and i used to like paint these cards with colors to make it like very similar to the ones in the game and whenever i have these cards like sometimes i imagine myself like a twisted fate and one card is for teleporting so i used the blue card and i try to measure myself teleporting like to any place i want to go to the park or another like city if i want to go there so yeah that was a lot of a lot of fun to be honest it definitely sounds cool to have some superpower yeah exactly so i used to imagine like being into these characters and as you mentioned there are like many more than 150 so that made the the the whole story is a lot more fun and a lot more like you know interesting because you yeah yeah do not have to stick to one personality or one champion you have like many so you can always get that exciting and adrenaline after playing a new champion and trying to get the most out of it the other thing yeah well yeah i i think i like the social about a little bit the the chat and the social aspect however is not what it it was not that the very big thing for for me it was just i like not the best experience yeah the the community is so toxic you know ev everybody knows that however i like like the the as you mentioned also the what is that the strategic play the strategic play yeah yeah the strategic yeah play and the stuff it feels like a mind game it is a mind game actually and yeah it means a lot of yeah yeah a lot a lot of like using iq and mind skills because it is a lot similar to a chess but with different colors and instead of like a specific piece of a che chess that is made in a specific way we know like i do not know if they call it the horse for example the horse for example it moves in a shape of l yeah so you are not like plan this so same thing every champion has has got his own or her own abilities so you know their movements and you try to predict the other teams or the enemy is movement and your movement as well and start to plan accordingly so yeah it is a yeah very very strategic playing and it uses like uses the the brain and stuff so it boosts the the cognitive or the intelligence ability just as the chess yes and i would actually argue that it could be harder even harder than chess because there would be yeah of course they so many factors that you have to account to yeah there are a lot of factors to interact yeah i mean like there there is the jungle monsters the minions and even the enemy champions you have to you know strategize every move because one mistake and you could fall to an enemy champion and yeah yeah especially because you used to play jungle raw so yeah you had a lot of pressure from our our team enemy team because they obviously they were flaming they will be flaming you if you mistake and is our team as well and everyone especially me of course i remember because honestly man it was a jungle difference you you helped me a lot in the mid lane i could have won like many of my games 0 come on man no you were the one who was emptying  yeah but it it it was definitely fun and and and it definitely requires lots of thinking you know strategizing and so on yeah getting the game objectives and the planning how to get each one of those especially when the bot lane is not helping to get the dragon yeah they are at different universe but they are still playing the game yeah and like and you have got like a very big responsibility because at the end of the day even if we did not help you at anything we will start framing we are blaming you for losing the objectives the friends the dragons and the rift herald and the baron yeah these are yes and actually one of the lanes that you would feel like they are playing chess indeed is the top lane they are 0 they are yeah yeah they they live in their own universe you know exactly especially nasus versus like kayle or something 2 people just want to stack and the good scale at the game so nasus players like especially the nasus mains they are like wow they are like yeah they they are a different category of people like they are not like other people like they are a different category they i imagine them like a child quiet person who wants to like just playing the chess and yeah yeah it i mean it almost feels like a pve game for them  you are just farming minions and so on you never see them during the game until like 30 minutes through so yeah they are definitely playing their own game yeah but you know what it is worth it if they are like a good they they want the good player the good players of them they are worth it because they do a huge impact over the entire game when like their they did their role proper properly yeah of course however i mean if you are absent during the entire game until 30 minutes and your team is so behind then there would be no coming back from that and that that is the saddest and the worst part to be honest like i i used top lane sometimes and i used to pick nasus to scale and stuff but like my my whole team totally entered the game like to extend that as like no coming back i cannot like i do not have enough armor or magic resistance to fight all of those like it is already too late even if i killed if i scaled to to like to the maximum still i i did not have yes the time to buy items and like stack items and stacks for the abilities so it is really too late and i feel like so sad because it is not fair for me i i have not even played the game i was waiting for the next phase of the game and i just i was just starting and 0 my god the game is gone what am i supposed to do now and it is not even fair yes and actually i mean i think that their rewarding style i mean when you take out an enemy champion it rewards you yeah instead of just doing nothing that is a cool aspect about the game because then i mean you feel like you actually did something to win a game and you know create an advantage for your team yes exactly that is gratification in essence so yeah i guess that is it for for this question okay perfect so let us move on to the 2nd question yes let us go okay so did you have a favorite book or film or a tv show or a cartoon as a child yeah but actually we are like we are going into the other section of the recording so let us end this one and start another one okay yeah okay bye bye (EDACC-C40_P1)
so hi again hi hi ha ha okay that is nice so let us start i will start 1st let me see so my id is f c 28 dash p one and my id is f c 28 dash p 2 that is nice so let us start with the passage okay perfect you go ahead okay please call stella ask her to bring these things with her from the store 6 spoons of fresh snow peas 5 thick slabs of blue cheese and maybe a snack for her brother bob we also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids she can scoop these things into 3 red bags and we will go meet her wednesday at the train station that is nice perfect okay please call stella ask her to bring these things with her from the store 6 spoons of fresh snow peas 5 thick slabs of blue cheese and maybe a snack of her brother bob for her brother bob we also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids she can scoop these things into 3 red bags and we will go meet her wednesday at the train station wha wha what i really like about this passage is that that it rhymes a little bit yes kind of yeah yeah okay so let us go to the next question okay which is yeah did you have a a favorite book or a film or a tv show or cartoon as a child yeah that is that is of course i had favorite like i had favorite books not one and yeah because i used to read a lot of novels so basically i used to like most of them because i was really picky as a child so yeah i only picked the the good ones so yeah one of them was let me remember one of them was the fear valley or the valley of fear something like that and it used to be brilliant and i used to think about it a lot even after i finished it for many many years cause i really really liked the character in this novel it was a police character but we did not know during the whole novel we we 0 yeah that was like something that we got dis we discovered at the end of the at the end of the novel that was really shocking huh it was  yeah it was surprisingly shocking yeah this man he was like very tough man very intelligent quick mind and very strong and yeah he has got like he was like wow the super male character you would like to be  yeah i like this yeah the gigachad character yeah i really liked this personality and i i even used to try to behave like him like just like league of legends i i whenever i like someone i i feel like i want to like get or try to be someone yeah be like them in some way yeah exactly so yeah eh so like i will tell you about the situation imagine at the the criminals club or the criminals clan he wanted to go into so he can get them caught they had something like an entrance exam yeah in which in which they had to do something that is very very hard like you know this metal thing that they used to print s s some shapes on the hor the back of the horses yes yeah yeah they put it on fire until the metal is like is red yes from the heat and then they print it on the body and the skin of the horse and it is a very tough thing imagine they used to do that in that clan on horses or humans on the humans who wanted to join them 0 wow that is something i definitely do not want to try yeah exactly they they like no one will ever want to try something like that yeah they used to do it eh on their shoulders and keep the shoulders exposed so anyone who goes around they know that this is one of these criminals or one of these clans so they fear them they do not want to like you do not want to get involved with those people like they are so criminal they are so tough because you actually can see this through once you see the the thing printed on their shoulder yeah yeah they have gone through that and yes so it it is like a rite of passage and also a print to identify the the clan right exactly not not only that like imagine that the the factor on on which you will succeed or do not succeed in this exam is that while they are doing that while they are melting your own skin printing the shape you should not say any like ouch aw or anything like that you should be as quiet as possible huh even if you want to scream so loud you you are not allowed to if you scream they they will kick you away or they will kill you because they are criminals and murderers and that seems like a test that i would definitely fail yeah yeah of course like 0 my god i can not even imagine and yeah now now here comes the protagonist my favorite character he enters this test and i wanted to know how would he act this brilliant mind so he was negotiating not to take the test but okay he said like okay it is just a stupid test i think that you are muted 0 i was muted so yeah what was the last thing you heard when he was going to enter the test that it was just some easy or stupid test yeah and then they they thought he he was afraid from from doing the test then he said okay then i will do it and they started heating up the metal  and then they put it on to the skin on the shoulder h his skin and then he did absolutely no reaction he did not even blink tough guy yeah he stood still like no not not even a blink that was amazing like everybody was shocked like 0 my god it was astonishing and that is why i was like i am so thrilled and i was into this character like look at how tough he is like any man of us like aspires to be a tough person and a tough man because that is what what is expected from men at the end of the day to be tough the the community expects this of us  eh so yeah and that was that was the eh the toughness and the thing that was real really like very aspiring yeah that was yeah i really love that so yeah and and that is one book should i go move into okay you move you talk about your book then we move into the the other section of the question yeah sure so my favorite book was an arabic book it is called diamond dust and that is a nice name yes cool it is a book that talks about well 1st of all it is just a a doctor and his father living alone and his father is paralyzed so he has to 0 the son has to take care of his father all of the time  however one day he returns to find that his father was murdered and then you know he he goes through and investigates finds out that his father had a past history and he used what they would call diamond dust to like assassinate people who had you know wow bad past or so  and then he decides to investigate who killed his father why he did it he meets this officer who starts directing him at a like a famous character a rich character in the country telling him that this is the one that murdered him due to some reasons he he keeps like investigating it is it you know it it keeps you interested all the time like attached to it you want to get to know what is going to happen moving forward and so on yeah i can tell like even imagining like i am i am trying to imagine since you said dust of diamonds i am trying to imagine what does like such dust look like yeah i mean i i i do not think that that thing actually exists or it does not do what they say it it did to people maybe but the the the idea itself is so catching yes exactly and actually what i liked the most about the book is that at the end the it is like a shock that he finds out that the one who murdered his father is actually the officer that he met 0 yeah because his father saw the officer dealing in drugs and so on and yes so the son took on and continued his father is path and assassinated the officer as well wow that is so cool actually and surpri what a surprise as well and yeah i love the idea like the notion of following the the father is path or the and heritage and like the legacy i i i like those kinds of notions because at the end of the day we are part of the past we are part of a legacy we are part of something like we did not just exist into the world like we we have not been thrown from nowhere here to the universe even if you feel like that you will be you will feel like in general a bit weak because your  legacy or your past you use that a lot in doing a lot of things like it gives you a source of power a source of knowledge about yourself if you are like if you if if it is as superficial as someone who has nothing to know about or who is like has no more or like he is brain washed or something like that he does not know anything about the past like  i i do not know he does not have something to connect to or maybe if we if he found if he or she found something to find something to connect to it is it will be like a bit weaker yeah connection than a connection that comes from the very past like  if you have a big an ancient family for example and you you are a descendant of this ancient family you know like you have got power you have got like yes history and yeah because life does not go like for forth and like to the back and forth life is go going going one way so yes definitely things that complete others yeah exactly and actually i mean i liked a lot the idea that that i mean you perceive an image of someone but no matter how close that person is to you you would never know everything about them like he had this idea of his his father that is like this very kind person who would never hurt someone and he is actually paralyzed too so he would not be able to yeah but then he finds out that his father was assassinating people by putting diamond dust in their drinks so you know in their dreams in their drinks wow fascinating yeah so i mean that it it is something to think about of course yeah i love those kinds of stories so yeah let us go to the others tv show yeah so you go ahead 1st 0 okay no worries i would love to go 1st about this one because my favorite show is one that is everybody is favorite show as well and i do not believe otherwise if someone said any other show was better than this one i would never believe that because we all know that breaking bad is the best of all time yeah i mean i i see people talking a lot about it but honestly i have not watched breaking bad yet 0 my god how are you still living yeah i know i know you are missing a lot you are you are you are not missing like i do not even know if you are worthy to watch the show anymore  like you missed the biggest opportunity in this life i mean i i have it on my to watch list i am going to watch it eventually however i mean i have not done that yet yeah the the question is does does the show have you on the list of worthy people who can you know who can actually watch them i do not know man i really do not know but yeah the dealer was talking about i am not going to point it out like or any spoiler i am not going to spoil anything for you but i am going to yeah speak about the general idea of the show yeah yeah the general idea of the show which is like it it appears on a trailer or something so it is not a big deal yes to to to be aware of it starts with a chemistry tutor or a chemistry teacher high school teacher who who develops cancer and a very good chemistry teacher or who used to be he wanted to do a phd and be a very like one of the doctors but the circumstance the the odds were not on on his favor so yeah yeah he just was so depressed about the cancer and what he is going to do about his life his life ending is ending soon and he has got a family and stuff but then he actually decides to do drugs but not do drugs he wanted to make drugs being huh one of the best chemi chemists in the on the whole world that he did the best drugs ever and it was a a substance called methamphetamine or meth and he started doing this meth and actually i do not know if i can go any further i do not want to spoil that piece of art the masterpiece or anything i do not want to spoil it in any how so yeah i will just have that i i will say that that is enough for you and it is not i i have not been saying it in a thrilling way i i think you should watch the trailer yeah it actually sounds interesting yeah but i think you should watch the trailer as well but anyway they yeah either of the trailer or any any like idea is it will not hurt one of the the actual tv show so you should actually watch the tv show to know what is in it like to know what is this yeah how cool it is yeah yeah because this is it is not a movie it is something like a a bit longer so you need to like live with the the the characters and see what is going to happen yes definitely 0 a cartoon as well yeah you can go ahead no you go ahead 1st okay so for the tv show i guess my favorite would be friends  i mean i have had so many memories with this show i like it very much because it you know it gives you these vibes you know it i i mean it boosts your mood it is comedy is not it yes it is it talks about i mean it is about a a group of friends and you know the drama sometimes the drama between them and most of the time the comedy you have this character which is called chandler he is like the sarcastic guy in the group yeah and there is joey who is not very smart but he  is good with the girls he has his way yeah that is the guy yeah and then there is ross who is like the nerd of that group who has a phd in paleontology and what is that it is he studies like the what does is it called like the fossils of dinosaurs and so on huh i see yeah and these are the 3 guys there is also 3 girls the 1st one is monica who is like obsessed with cleaning she  needs everything to be sparkling  and yeah and there is phoebe who is like you know at 1st you would think like how can a person be i do not know like this spontaneous but she is actually my favorite character of them all she is very spontaneous fun you would feel like she is one of your friends somehow really actually all of them would i mean a after 10 seasons you create a connection with them yeah i love that show of course yeah because the atmosphere the bond even with a show like especially with like fun people like that yeah it would absolutely feel like that yes exactly and the last one is rachel who is like this sassy girl who comes from a rich family yeah and yeah she is like crying most of the time if anything even small happens yeah and then it is mostly about how they deal with each other and other people and yeah it is very fun to watch you are going to enjoy it if you have not watched it yeah actually i had like a i had an idea that or a like a an impression that was telling me do not watch this because i see i saw the parts of it or like a quick lapse and it was not that fun so  i do not think they are like funny as they appear to be but no maybe because i i watch very little to be to be able to judge or know what is going on i think if i started like the show from the beginning it could be a lot a lot different yes to be honest the 1st season is not that great i mean you will have some parts where you will laugh but moving forward it will be funny yeah you are going to enjoy well the best the best thing that i actually love about the comedy things that usually the main characters they do not die yeah you get to live with them and have a happily peaceful life which is the thing that we deserve but actually like sometimes you you just want to i do not know well emotional people they will just want to cry and  and get them to feel miserable just like me for for absolutely no reason like if you ask me why would you do this i i just do not know but i it is like we we somehow like or love the feelings of sadness and the feelings of these dark feelings we we love it somehow or we enjoy it somehow i i  i used to i think dostoevsky the the russian writer used to describe s such enjoyment of a thing that are not that the thing that we are supposed to enjoy but yeah even though we are sad we enjoy the experience which is weird like how how is someone sad and they enjoy this the the experience at the same time yeah it is it is kinda like contradictory to each other but yeah it it is there is an like some sort of slight enjoyment that you get the beginning or at the ending or maybe i do not know now like when you feel sadness you get to feel happiness afterwards so maybe this transition transition that gives us these hormones or feelings yeah tha that is that is a good topic to think about is not it like philosophical yeah thing sort of thing about why do some people yeah i would love to apply for a degree in psychology and yeah yeah i mean you seem to be very much into it psychology psychology student so i think that is it for this recording okay perfect okay see you on the next one okay bye bye bye (EDACC-C40_P2)
hi my participant number is f c 28 dash p one hi and my participant number is f c 28 dash p 2 okay so where were we we were talking about our favorite cartoons and films yes exactly yeah i would like to start about this one because yeah that is my favorite film and i i never get bored of talking about that it is the prestige i do not know if you know it but it is about i do really yes i absolutely wh what do you like like it very much yeah it it is a very cool movie especially because it mentions many many of the thing that i personally love it is about tesla the greatest or the one of the greatest known physicist and of course i am major in physics that is why i love that idea and i love like yeah tesla as a scientist personally and his he had like a very bright mind and yeah that that was very cool and also the idea that the invention that they were talking about in the movie they kind of duplicated duplicating or replicating human humans or anything yeah that wa yeah that was really interesting and like living creatures yeah and the magic part was amazing really and they acted very like very brilliantly that was one of the best movies i ever saw like but 11 of the drawbacks of this movie that it is a little bit long it is it is too longer i think 3 hours of runtime something like that yeah however i mean i did not have any trouble with the length of the movie it was actually a pretty good one and my favorite part was the surprise when we when they revealed that they were actually twins and not just one person yeah and i also think that the movie teaches us like the the hatred or the envy can lead us absolutely nowhere at least to more hatred and more trouble and like more evil yes yes yes we get nothing out of it like remember when the one of the magician sound cut so yeah i was saying i think i muted myself or something yeah i was saying that we learn that envy and hatred and evil can lead us nowhere they only produce more envy and hatred and evil because yeah we saw when one of the magician is cause the death of the fiance of the other one by yes i do not know if it was by mistake or somehow because the movie revealed that this man had like psychological issues and they were twins and stuff like maybe one of them like was not responsible for for killing her and the other one was like maybe had a psychological issue as is so from the notes when when he stole the notes and then he is seeing he is seeing that he had like some you know bipolar disease something like that that illness ye yes i i tho i mean i do not remember that part very clearly because i i watched the movie like a long time ago yeah i see so yeah i was saying that this person one of the magician like dedicated their lives to get revenge and i mean to avenge his fiancee yeah and he just spent his life trying to kill the other person trying to cause him like severe pain or infli inflict upon him all the like the kinds of pain and miseries and the other one kind of did the same somehow so they were just they were just enemies to each other and they spent their life and instead of enjoying their lives they lived for destroying each other is and they had like they had both had kind of miserable life and like if this person moved on he could have like had a lo a lot better life than that i mean he could have been happy and avoided his death because at the end of the day yeah yeah he caused himself to be killed so he just lost his life lost his sanity and lost his happiness and everything like for nothing for something that is considered to be past even if it was very painful even if someone like stabbed you in the back yeah yeah regardless of how painful the issue is or the thing is it is it is like it is something of the past and we need to learn the like to learn to let things happen and let go in order for us to be to have the ability to live further because time marches on and only in one direction it never goes the other way yes that is definitely true okay so what about your favorite movie okay so i actually have 2 favorite movies i will start 1st by the english movie which was interstellar  this is yeah man wow absolutely one of my favorites yeah thanks for mentioning that yeah i mean i really love this movie i i was actually always fond of astrology and you know the the idea that the universe is so vast and black holes and so on when you read about it it is very very interesting and then seeing that these ideas are like on the screen in a movie and yeah that was brilliant the the i mean the movie actually had some accurate information it discussed the idea of the black hole and that you know when you move very close to a black hole time slows down yeah  from physics point of view i could definitely confirm and agree with that y yes so the the movie was i mean scientifically it was very good to some extent of course i mean they have to add some sci fi of course to make it interesting but i mean i liked it very much and also it had the the emotional drama to you know attract you and make you get involved there so yeah that was definitely one of my favorites and yeah i i even heard heard like the the producer of the movie had to attend physics classes in order to like in order to put the movie or produce the movie that way he had to go to physics courses can you imagine he was so dedicated yes exactly and i actually think that the the model of the black hole that they animated was done based yeah on actual physics as well it was so cool like amazingly cool i mean the the scene itself is so thrilling and eye catching and like capturing and i i like i can find words that describe how great the scene was yes i i mean i remember i think i watched the video back then that they even said they had to ask a scientist for help to make some calculations and determine how a black hole would look like in real life and they actually got it i mean i think they got it right because a few years ago when the 1st picture of a black hole was released it was kind of close yeah i love close yeah i i feel so yeah go on no no go ahead 0 okay so i i actually like the the the scene when he goes into the black hole that was very amazing and it captured my attention and i used to overthink about it like days and days like when he saw like the frames of the past like he used to like like he he went into the black hole and he yeah started seeing the the the past and he start he started seeing the past in like in some sort of like frames kind of way it was because the the he was like traveling through the past and he was seeing the moments of the past as a frames and he could like go into that exact frame that he wanted or that exact moment and interact with that and what caught my attention is like i used to imagine like this kind of how for example how a god sees the time you know the time space he he sees all the moments all like the past the present and the future all at the same time and he he can manipulate the space and time at the same time which is you know how great the creature the creator is yes definitely also some of the parts that i liked about the movie i mean that there was this part when he was at his ship and then he received a message from his daught daughter which was now almost 30 i think yeah that was so dramatic yes and emotional yes i i mean i almost cried at that scene it was very good i really did yeah yeah and i mean matthew mcconaughey did such a great job he is absolutely a great actor yeah and then my 2nd favorite movie is actually a japanese animation movie wow laugh yeah weirdly enough it was also a romance  it is called kimi no na wa or in english your name  the movie talks about 2 teenagers who wake up one day and find out that they have exchanged bodies they did not know each other but the boy found himself in a girl is body and the girl found herself in his body and then they have to you know live each other is life huh then they i mean they try to put rules to each other like leave a notes on the mobile asking who are you and then set rules like write down what you did in the day and do not do that do not do this and so on just to organize their lives when they are in the other person is body then they start falling in love with each other and then 0 my god then i mean it gets better then at some point the they stop exchanging bodies suddenly so the boy starts wondering what happened and starts looking for the girl he finds out that the girl actually died 3 years ago no way yeah after a comet crashed on the i mean on the school area where she lives no way that is so sad yes however it does not end in a sad way because he would start looking for her still and go to the same place finds out that she really did die in a comet crash and finds out like that this big crater where she used to live and somehow he travels back in time i mean you will need to watch it it is it is definitely amazing the movie is very good i will definitely do unless and it has a good ending i am not going spoil it for you well you already spoil like 80 to 90% of the whole movie i would definitely watch the movie but after these spoils spoilers i i am not quite sure because like things like i already know what everything is going to what what is anything that is going to happen so yeah but i think it is worth watching even after the spoilers it it is definitely is i mean i highly recommend this movie its it is my favorite one well i have 2 favorites as as you can see yeah i see i i can like i can imagine if i swapped like my body with a girl or like i i the 1st the 1st thing that i i think about it it could be very silly and like funny at the same time like how would they think of their private parts like laugh yeah yeah it was actually funny yeah this is so funny like the very 1st thing i would do is to like go to the laugh have a look at self naked in a mirror or something but however i do not think it would be like i am not quite sure because if we we we could ex exchange souls but maybe our sexual preferences it changed because we are basically in a different body and the the sexual preference is a matter of hormones i guess hormones and stuff so if i am in a girl is body i will be attracted to males or my my own body will not be attractive somehow so and it will be like i will kind of hate myself like it will be very sudden and very confusing that to have my sexual preference change that way and it would be sad at at the same time because i would love to to see the naked body where yes or they they did not discuss this part thank god yeah exactly just they they would be interesting that is it and like yeah it is kind of experiment okay so and that is cool let let us see if we can move into another question okay have you mentioned your favorite cartoon have we talked about the cartoons 0 right yeah we actually did not talk about our favorite cartoons would you like to go 1st or would you like me to go 1st yeah i can go 1st well le le at the beginning like i used to like my whole childhood was like watching cartoons that was like 99% of my childhood so i lived with cartoons i have many favorite cartoons i love almost all of them so i like i would briefly mention one of the things that i like the most one of them was pinky and the brain those were 2 lab rats they one of them was dumb and the other one was like a genius like the brain he used to yes i i remember yeah it was very funny yeah it was so cool and like yeah like i i loved rats and then and how brain is always pla was always planning to rule the world and control the world dominate the whole wo world the human world and despite the fact that he was merely a lab rat he was so small he had so little things to work with yet he had this big ambitious goal or dream to control the world is not it so like so cool like yes it that was actually very cool and it was very funny yeah it teaches us like some some lessons about ambitions and like it does not matter how big the dream is you can like having a brain you can always plan for it and yeah the yeah we can we can never turn a br a blind eye on the pinky the funniest character ever the dumb mouse yeah and i actually do not remember if he ever was able to you know like achieve his dream it was like kind of the the main source or the main cause of the failures of the brain brain plans and however i like the or i love the fact that he he did not like they did not they they fought but they were actually friends like they had each others and they they like they kind of loved each other so they they are 2 yeah friends so despite the fact that they argue a lot because brain ha had plans and pinky was just as spontaneous going around they actually at the end of the day they they could not lose each others yes exactly yeah and my i will talk about my favorite cartoon as well 0 okay so my favorite is shaun the sheep if you know this yeah that was actually one of my favorites because it was very funny and the idea that you have like sheeps that are so smart you know and the the dog who tries to hurt them that was yeah a very cool idea and it was i think it was made in stop motion which is like the you know like these like clay characters and then they take pictures and then move it and then take another picture and they will combine really yes i think so wow and then they combine it until they do you think so but you are not sure yes i mean stop motion i that is i think the general idea of stop motion huh i see but i mean it it is very cool and the the show was very funny yeah i i totally agree with that and yeah i i would also like to mention another cartoon that i could never like forget and i really wanted to mention which is ninja turtles yeah because one thing i really loved ninja the other thing is that i love turtles as well so having both of them in like the same the same show that was so cool to me i loved i liked i loved ninja to the exte to till the extent that i ordered a ninja suit some in the past and i i used to ask my brother and he he used to do martial arts and that stuff and i used to ask him to teach me ninja arts teach me ninja arts i want to be like a real ninja okay i will climb homes and like do awesome things and i can fight and defend the weak and all these heroic ninja things i liked the stealth and like the the the idea that the shadows and they cover their faces and they are like sneaky and nobody knows them like a lot of secrets and a lot of like like it it feels so cool till till even till now i still want to order another ninja suit and go to learn ninja i love the shuriken the you know the the stars yeah that is made from metal they used to fight with and ninja had many like weapons to fight with sticks and shuriken swords and many other things i used to like love weapons and the the art the art itself of like using weapons and also yeah so it was very interesting to me to to to see like ninjas work and what like the awesome and cool stuff that they can do i also loved the the splinter what was the other master splinter yeah yeah it was like a very respectful character and yeah like feels so strong and so wise i used to take his his wisdom for real like it is yeah his quotes and the stuff i used to write them and live into the character and i i i somehow i wanted to be a ninja but like when i am older like a lot older at the age of this of master splinter i wanted to be like him as well to be a master of all that ninja arts and start teaching ninja to the new generations yeah i think that if you would like to start learning i mean you will need to travel to china or japan or something yeah japan it is originated in japan and yeah yeah i still think till this day that ninja is a pretty cool martial arts it is a martial arts and it is like a good one that is that is like that is not a weak martial arts but it like it used to to be some sort of an art not like the a very common martial arts that people do i think the best the most famous things were even till now the karate and the kung fu yeah i actually used to i mean i did study or train in some kung fu before really kung fu is a right chinese by the way unlike karate right karate is japanese i actually never knew really but you used to yeah wow it was like for just one month or so  i mean it did not last that long huh i had to say this yeah what else like i am thinking what else have i missed a mention about the ninja turtles yeah of course their intro song it was so great actually it used to make me very motivated and very energetic and the the like charged and hardwired like yeah ninja turtles yeah it made me go crazy whenever i heard that you listened to the arabic or the english opening both actually both i i mean i actually do not think i ever watched the cartoon the ninja turtles cartoon i mean what but i did watch some of the movies no way no no you are not saying that to me you have not watched ninja turtles how could you not yeah i am sorry like i i will not let that go like this i will like when after this recording i will let you watch like an episode or 2 i remember one of my friends he started watching ninja turtles like like one or 2 years ago he wanted to like rehash the old memories and nostalgic stuff but he got caught into the the the the cartoon and he was really into it and he even finished and he continued to see all the all the episodes up until the very last episode they stopped the show wow he definitely got hooked up there yeah you can you you you can you you you must actually i will like i i can rewatch it with you it will be a very fun activity we can like yeah i definitely will at some point yeah that will be cool so i think we are yes almost about to finish this recording so would you like to add anything no thank you so so it is like almost 3 more minutes something like that i think that we are actually done let me check well no not yet i still i have a timer here and yeah like 3 minutes to go really 0 okay yeah so let us see we can definitely talk

chance to eat pizza i definitely do but is it considered fast food i think so because i think yes i i think so yeah yeah the yeah the dough can make you like can affect our like our fitness it cause

time outside we were also going to the beach together with our families we were doing some picnic we we were the same age so we were going in the same school it is fun being kids too bad it passed so fast that time and what about you what kind of games did you use to play what did you do as a kid we used to play mostly outdoor games too we were gathering all the kids from my neighborhood i i used

dresses for my dolls but my brother always was hiding me those things 0 that is really bad and how did you find  the clothes at the end yeah i was finding it somehow because they were always on the same place and you know and how often did you use to go to the beach with your friends i used to go 2 or 3 times per week we are living near the sea so we were often going to a beach we we were going around 4 p m until the sunset so it was the best time to do to swims a little bit to play with the other kids to watch the sunset actually the the water was so so good at that time and it was not so much crowded and i really enjoyed that time and you well i i really loved going to the beach and i still love it and we were always waiting for some adult to come with us because our parents will not let us to go alone because we were too young right and we were going almost every day depends if if an adult is free every day we will go every day and we used to go cycling or walking by the beach yes i also like i liked cycling yes and i always wanted to to bring some b books with me so we were swimming almost all day and on the breaks we were reading books from school the teacher used to give us i do not really remember if i had any favorite book but i really enjo enjoyed them and what about you did you bring any book any favorite books on the on the beach or you just really wanted to get tanned and swim all day long no i was bringing only both at the beach usually i was reading the books from from school in the morning so i had to spend 2 or 3 hours per day reading all the the books and another plus literature i really enjoyed reading reading also now when i am older i enjoy reading a lot i had some favorite books i i do not remember the name of the book i liked so much but it was about some twins i think it was the double lottie the name its story 0 yes i know that book yeah you know when 22 sisters are getting to know each others after a couple of times they were separated after their birth and luckily that book had a very happy ending so i liked that book a lot that is great i can not remember yeah i really loved reading stories with my sister especially before going to bed and we were reading the stories from the cartoons we used to watch yeah also me and my brother were watching cartoons all the time well actually not all the time but for a couple of hours per day let us say 2 or 3 because my mother and my father did not let me let us watch for the whole day i liked the cartoons especially tom jerry the spongebob especially and also now i am watching spongebob from time on time i also like simpsons and yeah maybe frozen i am sorry frozen yeah also frozen it is really nice cartoon yes it was very popular but then i liked to watch cartoons that had yeah that has so many many episodes like the simpsons or tom jerry and i think frozen was something like 2 or 3 episodes it is like a movie right yes yes as i remember and did you use to play any sports on the beach for example we loved playing volleyball or just some regular sport games in the water because i really loved sports i used to play basketball when i was younger and today till today i really i really love sports in general and that is why i always and we used to play different kinds of sports on the beach yeah also we were used to play a lot of sports in the beach we were playing volleyball and we were playing different sports in the water but we liked to swim a lot i am a very good swimmer so i liked to compete with the others not only with my friends but also with my family so i am always more into the water swimming than playing some sports also now i am a very sport person so i like running playing g i i do play also now volleyball i like doing pilates i like playing tennis i am i am very attached person to the nature so i like also spending time in the nature i like going around to the sea i like going in the mountains i like skiing wanting i have not learned till now and that is snowboarding and this winter when we are going to the mountains i would like to do some snowboarding as well did you have you done it before well not actually i am not into winter sports much i am more in outdoor sports like running and swimming i i do not like winter and we never used to go on a winter holiday i do not know why maybe we could not afford that but we are lucky we live on a place like this so we are available and we can go to the beach whenever we want and yes i really love hiking and being more connected with the nature i use my free time to go for a walk for a walk in the mountains and that makes me feel really good and we did that when we were kids too so almost every kind of sports that we do it is it is good it makes me feel very good and if tell me if you for example if you were to go on a holiday where would you like to go and why do you have any preferred place you want to go or you just want to go on a holiday whenever i like going to holidays i do not have some place which i prefer to go often but for the next trip i would like to go on bali so i think i want to go there because i like the nature so much it has beautiful beaches it is not that trip like the other places in europe let us say or in america it has a wealth nature very good photos can be done there for instagram i also like to meet some new culture want to meet people i have never met before in my life so i think if i go there it will be something new for me so that is great that is a place yeah it is a place with lang long sand beaches with as i said before wild nature many animals so you can see there so i think it will be a great place for a 2 weeks vacation or 3 but let us hope this summer we will go somewhere so we will see and what about you did you think about some particular place you would like to visit or you have visited and you would like to visit it again well i would really like to go to somewhere in place where there is a beach in front i really love summer and i would go wherever it takes i i want to go for example maybe in mexico and because there are really interesting places and beaches to see there and if i choose to go yeah so full of full of history full of what full of history yes yes and if i would choose to go somewhere in europe i would go in italy or spain and there are many cities i want to visit there too and i think that i will have this opportunity soon and if i would say if or if we talk about dream house or dream home i would really like to have a beach house in the future somewhere maybe in italy or spain and what about you do you have any particular dream home or house you want to have in the future maybe a mountain house or beach house what do you prefer more actually i would prefer to have some little house in somewhere in the mountains but i i would like a little also to be included also swimming pool so i can enjoy all my free time not only during the winter but also in the summer away from the crowd or from the cities and yeah it will be nice having a small house in in italy yeah i like italy so much there are many places much much for the to visit there but also spain is good yes maybe portugal yeah also portugal i have never been there you no i have not been there but it is on my wishlist 0 hopefully we will go there soon yes and do you have for example any favorite place that you have already been that you can add like your favorite holiday ever sure venice number one i like that city so much i have been a couple of times and i realized that it is much more better if you go there during some working days from monday till friday actually not friday thursday and to go there at early in the morning at sunrise or later in the evening and watch the sunset venice is the most magical city in the whole world i like it so much and if i have to choose a city where to go right now and just to take my passport and to go straight to the airport i would choose venice that sounds nice and you well i was in venice like i think 5 or 6 years ago yes i really liked the place but i think for now it will not be one of my favorite holidays because i did not have much time to walk through the city we were only for a day but i can say maybe my last holiday was in spain i really had a good great time there are many museums and cathedrals that you can see there and i would really love to go again to see the parts that i already miss and i really love going shopping in germany for example i really like following fashion buying nice clothes and what about you which country you prefer and what kind of style do you prefer do you like everyday fashion and how young people dress nowadays or wha what is your opinion about that i like the everyday fashion because the young people are getting to to dress more casual so it is very comfortable for a girl or a woman dressing in a skirt or a dress combined with some sneakers you can go everywhere with this combination not only out for a drink but you can also wear this combination to work i like casual style a couple of years ago i used to to dress so elegant but i was al always with high heels but i do not like high heels anymore as i am getting older i am using i am used to wear more sneakers so i like the styles that style so much so depending on on like of the occasion i will for sure wear high heels but nowadays i am not wearing them so much i also like sports style so i like when i am jogging to wear my wearing the running shoes wearing some sports top and some leggings but most of the time as i said i am dressing casual and also i like so much shopping i think italy and paris for the shoppers  once i have been in actually i have been twice in milan i like the city so much and i was there for the sales period so i used to buy so many things that were so much cheaper than here and it is very good that we they were with high quality materials meet so i really hope to go there once more and to do a very good shopping i really miss shopping these days and what about you what is your style and what what do you wear where do you want to do shopping well i love casual style especially sports style i i do not like wearing heels maybe i have not worn them for years i really love wearing sneakers jeans and casual dresses everything and oversized clothes i do not like uncomfortable clothes and i really love shopping especially when there are sales because i do not want to spend much money for something that i can buy later on sale yeah me too and i also love to buy skin skin products i really enjoy and i love taking care of my skin especially in summer because it requires special treatments and maybe they are a little bit more expensive than some clothes but i think that the skin routine is the most important especially in those summer days and i really love buying sale and i sale clothes and the products and i would list germany as one of the most the best countries when you ge where you can buy really nice products for really reasonable prices and what about you do you spend much or ma m much money for skin routine and do you usually find sale products where you mentioned yeah that you want to go shopping yes i am always doing some shopping when it is summer or winter and where when the sales starts i do not like spending the whole sum of price for one product because i can find cheaper i also like to like searching on the internet there are a lot of web pages you can do some online shopping instead of going in the in the store and usually on the web you can find some cheaper products for example 20 or 30% cheaper than products in the store so i usually wait for the sales the shopping i also like spending money on skincare it is very important for me cause we all want to have good skin so i am not buying so much makeup i am more investing abou in cleansers in toners in creams i am not doing so much makeup i am trying to do as many as i can from time on time i like to do to my makeup to be done by some makeup artist but not so much at home because they are doing they are putting so much of their products i also like wearing and buying some jewelry i am always wearing a ring and yeah actually the ring is one of my favorite jewelry and the earrings which i have forgotten them i love so much earrings and you that is great well from yeah jewel from jewelry i li i love just no i do not like earrings that much i do not usually wear them i prefer not to wear them most most of the time because when i am doing sports i i do not feel comfortable which with the jewelry on me and i put very little makeup so i usually find inspiration for all this stuff and buying from the social media i watch tutorials like for clothes for makeup for for jewelry but at the end i choose what do i want to buy and what i do not really want to buy and i usually watch food tutorials and lately i really love to cook and to try new recipes to cook healthy meals especially now to and i usually write down on screenshot the recipes and i think that the social media especially instagram is one of my biggest inspirations for for all this stuff and what about you do you want to make experiments with new recipes or you just cook your regular meals like you you you you used to do every time i like cooking i like very much so my mother is having some old book where she she writes all the recipes she cooks mainly those are some are old traditional meals but nowadays i also use so much instagram and pinterest as well i like cooking so much i like to discover new cuisines i like to discover new meals actually every time i have some free time i am cooking something last time i cooked something it was yesterday i made some strawberry cake and it was so delicious although i like more salted things to cook i also do some do some desserts nowadays i am i am eating no carbs so i am always on proteins veggies that are having low carbs so today i think my last meal was chicken with broccoli and it was so delicious what about you what did you eat today well i had meat and salad and some home homemade cherries from my cherry tree in the yard tastes excellent 0 i like cherries so much and also strawberries this is the perfect period for them and they are so good you know it is for the cherries i do not like th when they are frozen but the strawberries i like to eat them when they are frozen cold some special flavor to the wine can you repeat the last sentence because i did not hear hear well and here we are going to finish our conversation yeah sure so i like i like when i am eating frozen strawberries that is great i usually put them in put them in a glass of wine and the strawberries are adding some special flavor too i do not like frozen cherries because i do not think they are it is good but for the strawberries i recommend you when they are frozen and add to the to the wine but not only to the wine when you add to a sparkling water and some i also like doing some smoothies and add there some strawberries not cherries but strawberries will be fine to add some oats some so i also that is great like to do some some good food which is not so greasy and which is healthy that is great so do you eat healthy food yes i prefer eating healthy food and i try to eat as more healthy than i can afford so okay that is that is great sharing your experiences and talking about our lives it went really well in this conversation so i am going to wish you a nice day 0 thank you so much it was also a pleasure for me speaking to you i wish you a nice day as well do you have any plans for today well i think i am going to have a nap now and rest it is weekend right 0 yes finally it is weekend we can rest a little bit longer as we are working all the time from monday till friday when it is saturday and sunday it is actual paradise for us going for a slow walk or doing some slow things it is very important when we can rest our bodies and our minds and not doing nothing just being crazy doing a couple of naps during the day but also is important to go for fresh air outside yes not to remain all the time in the house yes i i will go a little bit later outside too okay so thank you and goodbye thank you so much we will see later each other so we can go bye for a walk and continue our conversation outside bye bye bye (EDACC-C44-00)
hi my participant number is f c 52 p one hi my participant number is f c 52 dash p 2 when was the last time that you visited saint andrews not that long ago actually it was probably around a year ago or maybe less it was around about christmas time actually when i think about it just before christmas i absolutely love saint andrews i try and go at least twice a year do you remember we used to go when we were younger with mom and dad that is right i have got really fond memories of going there for holidays when we were younger the beach over there is amazing do you play golf there no i do not play golf anymore i used to when i was younger it is a very good course though and whenever you go out there there is all sorts of people from all different countries that travel far and wide to play there that is right it is world famous is not it what is the name of it again the old course the old course sure it is lovely i assume it has been there for a long time then yes i believe it has been there for for some time yeah but it is it has got a lot of heritage surrounding it i believe it has been there for nearly 500 years at least wow yeah since the beginning of golf i believe that is that is potentially where golf started in a lot of people is eyes that is amazing there is so many lovely golf courses around there is some really lovely ones up in dunbar i do not play golf myself but we have visited these places and i am sure it was dunbar there was a beautiful golf course right on the water absolutely stunning and like you say there was a lot of people from a lot of different countries that have traveled over specifically just to play golf at that particular course dunbar is a lovely place a lovely part of the world i love the east coast berwick et cetera berwick upon tweed north berwick all these places are lovely they really are i i have been there north berwick i do not think i have been to berwick upon tweed but north berwick certainly is absolutely beautiful as well it is not too far away from where i live either so it is quite nice to even just go away for a day trip absolutely it is it seems a lot further than where it is though i agree because i believe it is not that far from england no no it is the way the way the the country is shaped effectively that england comes up further on the right hand side and as a result it is right next to berwick upon tweed which is in england that is amazing really is not it yeah it is all these things that you do not realize i love all parts of scotland i love the north of scotland do you go there much well yes i went away last year we did the north coast 500 so we visited lots of different places there not as many as the last time when we did it though we did not feel the need to visit other places again although beautiful but with wee one probably a bit too remote for what we need but absolutely beautiful is it a bit too much for robson well the he is good at traveling the traveling is not the the hard bit it is just more the remoteness you know when you have got a little one and you need something from a shop or whatever or children can be unpredictable sometimes so their needs 0 absolutely their needs can be great and you need to sort of have things available to you and certain places when there is not things around for quite a while it does make things a bit difficult although beautiful scenery and lots of things to do historically but with a child a young child not as many to be fair but really nice to enjoy as as an adult like john 0 groats for instance that is beautiful up there but once you are there there is not very much in the way of things to do per se beautiful beach beautiful scenery but again it is away up at the very very very top of scotland so it is just quite far from other places yeah just a wee bit too far away it is a place i have never been lived in scotland my whole life i have never been to john 0 groats somewhere that i think it would be quite interesting to see you have been 0 absolutely it is you know we traveled from there back home we did it all in the one go and that was a long journey i am sure it was about 6 or 7 hours by the time we got home considering we would made so many stops on the way gradually traveling up but certainly going from there back home it was a very long journey so i would not recommend it for a day trip but definitely worth going to see no it is certainly not somewhere i would go for a day trip but i would love to be able to travel there and and just visit it and say that i have been there is a lot of people that go from john 0 groats all the way down to the bottom of england to say they have went from one end of britain to the other i think that would be a great trip 0 absolutely i i have seen people before that were doing the north coast 500 and they were cycling they were cycling it amazing what people can do when they really test their endurance but certainly 0 absolutely i am not sure if it is something i would be able to do to to cycle it all because the terrain is difficult you know even in a car it is tricky 0 absolutely it is it is it is getting a lot busier up there though like i have i have heard stories that you you are traveling along and and there is there is lots of different cars parked at the side of the road et cetera well that is it when we did it before it was not that popular it was only just a new thing but since then it is gained a lot of attention so again lots of people travel from all over the world to come and see and quite rightfully so because scotland should be shown off like that it is absolutely exquisite some of the places you would not even think it was in scotland and we are really really lucky and blessed to have that in our own country but in terms of the locals i am not sure how they feel about it the extra traffic and pollution although in a way it is probably good for passing trade well absolutely the people that work up there and people that have businesses up there will be cashing in big time which really now i think it is it is i think it is absolutely great that they are they are they are getting attention that they deserve well that is it these little towns unlike scotland and edinburgh and other big places other big cities they have a lot of tourism coming and going whereas these little towns they do not so i guess in a way it would be beneficial although i am not sure if the older generation would see it that way well perhaps not perhaps not they a lot of the time prefer a quiet life however it is bringing more money to these little places and it is it is boosting the economy in general the north coast 500 is is is a lot is an unbelievable thing for for scotland to have achieved and for them to be able to offer it to people that are going to come and visit here is is is just blowing in my mind definitely is there is a lot of different things that you can do there as well in terms of the traveling you know you can have you can travel and camp you can travel in a camper van you can stay in the local hotels or bbs which are usually very full so i reckon if you were going to do anything like that you would need to book it well in advance i do not think you could just turn up and expect to have availability 0 no no way certainly during the summer being able to to to secure any accommodation up near the north coast 500 during the summer would be almost impossible unless you booked well well well in advance i think definitely there is not very many of them as well because these little towns are small they do not have big hotels and it is usually just small bbs or airbnbs they are very popular nowadays so perhaps maybe more things like that that are self catering set up but people do not tend to stay in the same place for a very long time so it is probably quite suitable for the hosts and for the people who use them yeah i think so i think you might be right with the airbnb idea i think you might find that people who have larger houses up there and perhaps renting out a room or 2 and and and making a bit of money out of it i do not see why not either as long as they are quite happy to do that and the people are happy to stay there then you know it works for everybody i guess definitely i have stayed in a few really nice airbnbs over the years and it seems to be really really popular now 0 really whereabouts i stayed in one in edinburgh just last year with my friends that was really nice and it had an access to an outdoor space as well it was sounds very okay sounds very good it was more of a upstairs downstairs flat i would say you know it had access to downstairs and upstairs and it was it was really really nice i am trying to remember what area it was in now of edinburgh but that was lovely and quite reasonable obviously when you look at it as a whole but when it was split up between 6 people it worked out very reasonable for the weekend as opposed to what you would pay for a hotel absolutely i can imagine and edinburgh is absolutely lovely anyway like a lot of the houses over there are are are 2nd to none the architecture in edinburgh i absolutely love it edinburgh really is a lovely place especially at christmas time i always think it is such a lovely to be 0 absolutely and i believe being from glasgow you are you are almost quite biased towards glasgow however personally i prefer edinburgh i would say i feel there is a there is a better a better vibe over there there is a lot more relaxed atmosphere over there than than in glasgow what about yourself i do really like edinburgh i love glasgow as well do not get me wrong but more recently when i have been into the city center it is it is changed there is a lot of shops and buildings that are unoccupied and for some reason it just gives off a bit of a kind of messy a messy feel to it i am not entirely sure why when i had been in just recently it it had been a while since i had been in to be fair but i just felt like it had changed a lot and i remember it to be a place that was really buzzing with a lot of things happening i just felt it was a bit stagnant you know there was not very many shops that i could see that i i would have went into and i think you know you just wonder how these shops can sustain i mean i am not saying that my opinion is over everyone else is but it is just certain shops you just wonder how they they can still be going after covid and it is strange is not it yeah i think there is a lot of regeneration going on though and i think they are trying to improve the place generally cause it has become you are right it has become quite stagnant i think they are trying to improve the place and and regenerate the city center seems to be an emphasis on food outlets and and bars et cetera but i do not know if the developers are are looking at it and seeing that is maybe the way to go nowadays they have certainly pedestrianized a lot of the city center as well more than it it used to be anyway like at the top of sauchiehall street et cetera and that that is primarily bars and restaurants up there well that is right and i know that they were making more access for the cycle lanes and things up there which i did notice when i was in the city center just and it was maybe a couple of weeks ago now but i did notice a lot more people on bikes cycling down sauchiehall street where the shops were and and around all the people which i thought was just sort of encouraging the wrong things in my opinion having a little one that sort of adds to the sort of stress of the day really when you are and trying to get some shopping and then someone is coming d down the street hurtling round on a bike does not really make for much enjoyment when you when you have got a little one who is wanting to just walk by themselves as you can imagine yeah absolutely and you need to have eyes in the back of your head for these these things as well well absolutely in in a normal or instance cyclists are not really allowed on the pavement so there should be a bit of information out there for the city center and the shopping areas that people should not be on their bikes because it is not just the young children it is the elderly as well yeah and the issue is as well it needs to be more defined the the what is pedestrianized and what is for for cyclists you obviously have cycle lanes popping up all over the city now which to be fair i think is great it encourages people to be healthier and reduces emissions however in pedestrianizing sorry pedestrianized areas such as glasgow city center you need to have it more defined so you do not have cyclists you know flying around pedestrians et cetera well definitely not because most people who are in there in the city center they are in there to use the shops they are not thinking about someone coming past them on a bike so i guess it is just down to common sense again the people on the bikes should be taking care but i could count at least 3 people going far too fast down the slope of sauchiehall street which did not sit very well with me but certainly it is a good thing that they are bringing in more more access for cyclists where they are supposed to be cycling because it is really going to help with the overall current climate crisis what do you think about all that the climate crisis yep i think i think the world is definitely going in the right direction in terms of education on the climate crisis i think educating is only part of it though and you need to actually ensure that action is being put into it i think cop 26 was was a relative success i think that in reality politicians do understand the the grave nature of of the impact of global warming now and there seems to be an emphasis on ensuring that targets can be met targets are absolutely everything now and that can be reducing emissions that is that are that are imposing low emission zones in city centers to encourage people to to to use public transport which again yesterday i was just driving along and i seen that bus in front of me and it was a an electric bus so if people were taking electric buses and trains et cetera into the city center the emissions are getting cut completely almost from certainly from that person is journey anyway and there is an emphasis obviously on phasing out diesel and petrol cars eventually in this country so i think most governments hearts are in the right place when it comes to to global warming but people individually need to take action even just recycling et cetera it all needs to be done and and and hopefully hopefully things can be reversed but there is a lot of argument which i am not massively aware of so i can not comment comment on it massively but there is a lot of argument that it is big business that really need to change their their ways what about yourself yes i completely agree with that there is a lot of factories producing a lot of harmful chemicals into the atmosphere so that certainly is something that needs to be looked at but yes as you say it is down to everybody to play their part now and i think certainly as you say about the education it is about educating the younger generation in how to look after our country and you know our environment in a way that it is going to have a knock on effect for the future years because i think sometimes with all the plastic production and all these things certainly when we were younger there was no such thing as recycling so there is and that is probably been going on for a very long time so i think no no i if if there was anything like recycling when we were younger it was in a very small level and then you wonder how long that has been going on for prior to us all the plastic production and all the other things that have been produced and just discarded these things do not break down they are not biodegradable so you do wonder then how how long it will take for these things to you know how long it will take for the world to get on top of all that before then they move on to the next lot but it is really good that they are bringing out a lot more biodegradable packaging all these different things that can be recycled easily and you are seeing it a lot more now where it is being enforced where things are being recycled and made into new things so therefore even i am amazed at the things that can be made out of recycled plastic or glass things like that and yeah absolutely for younger people to start realizing that now they will be in the so they will not know any different when it comes to them growing up and teaching their children so hopefully by then it it will really really help but yes as you say every it is down to every person as an individual to make that change little we will get there little by little hopefully yeah i am hopeful yeah it is it is it is a tough one though because not everybody is willing to actually do it which which makes a an issue but as as you said it is it is all about educating the younger generation and and making sure that they are under no illusions as to what is the right thing to do well that is right certainly in my mind anyway i agree because i really like the look of these new electric cars it is amazing how silent they are absolutely yeah it is really amazing and i know someone who has got a hybrid so that actually means that it can run on electricity and it can also run on petrol so you can flick between the 2 so technically that is really good in terms of for the environment 0 absolutely do you think you will get a an electric car eventually i think eventually yeah i think eventually most people will it is all about having the infrastructure at your home as well though and being able to ensure that having a an electric or the hybrid works for yourself absolutely because i suppose once you do get that you would have to have a charger installed on your house so there is the sort of yeah process of that as well is not there yeah and and that is the thing people i am not saying everybody but i think there is certain people like that do not think that the why the of having an electric car and and it still costs money to actually charge a car up et cetera and it is just as an alternative to having to fuel up that is true i would be interested to see how much it costs to charge up a car at home from your own energy usage would not that be interesting it would certainly with the energy prices going up it would to see if you could counterbalance it with the cost of diesel or petrol at the moment certainly i do not think it would be as much to have it fully charged because a full tank of diesel or petrol right now is astronomical the prices you will know that yourself 0 absolutely and i think that i think that actually as a benefit to having an electric car nowadays certainly with with the way fuel prices are going definitely it must be more co cost effective in the long term i suppose it is a bit like the solar panels on your house initially they would be a big outlay in terms of cost but then over time it would balance itself out because you would be regenerating that money back in terms of paying for it through energy bills yep yep 0 absolutely i think it is i i do generally think that it is a great idea having electric car a lot to against it and and as you said earlier on sorry the the the noise and how quiet it is et cetera a lot of companies try to develop specific noises so that people can hear them coming et cetera that is that is amazing how quiet i i just could not get over i actually got afraid because one came up behind me in a multistory car park and i genuinely did not hear it and i i got afraid because i just was not expecting it so i suppose in a way that is really good but in a way it will take a lot of time to get used to that i think certainly for the older generation again you know 0 absolutely it is probably easier for for the younger generation like us to to understand the the needs behind it et cetera but we are going to have a generation of current children growing up with electric cars and not knowing any different this is true remember when we were young we used to think about flying cars by this time the 2000s there was going to be flying cars and all these different ideas that were floating around i would not be surprised if that yeah exactly i would not be surprised if that was going to be a real thing in a good few years time the way things are going i am sure it will eventually i am sure it will eventually and i i do not doubt for one minute somewhere in the world where you can probably get a flying car there probably will be there will be a prototype somewhere no doubt yeah i have certainly not seen one though (EDACC-C46_P1)
hi my participant number is f c 52 p one please call stella ask her to bring these things with her from the store 6 spoons of fresh snow peas 5 thick slabs of blue cheese and maybe a snack for her brother bob we also need a small plastic snake and a big toy for the kids she can scoop these things into 3 red bags and we will go meet her wednesday at the train station hello my participant number is f c 52 dash p 2 please call stella ask her to bring these things with her from the store 6 spoons of fresh snow peas 5 thick slabs of blue cheese and maybe a snack for her brother bob we also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids she can scoop these things into 3 red bags and we will go meet her wednesday at the train station so when you were growing up what was your favorite game to play i actually enjoyed when we used to play hide and seek up near the mountains there was a lot of space to row the boat there was a lot of hiding places and we obviously knew the area do you remember when mom used to take us up there and let us run about mud that is right it is such an open space up there and there are so many tree there are so many trees and really cool hiding places as you say i remember playing down by the barn do you remember that little bridge yes i do remember the bridge the little stone one what a lovely place that was that is right we used to throw the stones in and see who could throw the throw the farthest over to the other side that is right i remember that little barn causing many havoc in our family i think i know i think that it is still there to this day although there was a lot of flooding up there recently so i am not too sure how stable it is because i remember back then it was always a bit old and worn so hopefully it is still there i must go up there and see what other games did you like to play just liked swimming in the lake up there that is right that looks beautiful up there i remember we used to jump in as well that is right it was never too deep though never too deep that you could not enjoy walking about round it et cetera no that is true and do you ever remember when we got the little fishing rods and we caught those tiny little fish that had stripes on them that is right were they not baby tadpoles no i think that was at another time we we caught little fish and they were sort of a silvery kind of brown color they were not much bigger than your pinky finger i am not sure if you remember that that was quite a while ago yeah i think i do remember that mom used to let us look at them for a while and then throw them back into the water that is right we do not we did not ever want to keep them well we did want to keep them as pets but mom would always say it is much kinder to throw them back in that is right do you remember we used to play football out there i do that is right and we used to use that big oak tree as the goals that is right yeah i think people still use that out there i have seen people recently up there playing football and they play exactly the way we did for almost 20 years ago that is amazing is not the same space it is still used the same way but we have such fond memories growing up there and lots of generations will probably do the same absolutely it probably used exactly the same long before us as well that is that is true it is nice to know that they are preserving that area and not actually building any houses on it well not yet anyway no well i think part of it is protected i am sure that has so hopefully they will not move on to that part necessarily but i know that there is a lot of work going on up there to do with scottish water that is right i have seen that recently a lot of pipes going in that is right i think it is to do with the waterworks actually up at near yeah i see i know where that is yeah well hopefully they get it sorted soon and they can leave it alone again well that is such a beautiful space update anyway talking of beautiful spaces have you got anything but for your holiday this year yes go to spain what of yourself lovely yeah we are going to way to spain also but we are not going until the end of the year really we have got friends over there so we are going to visit them for christmas what about yourself you are going in spain going to alicante for 2 weeks that is great that is lovely there i have heard it is really really nice i have not been myself but there it is beautiful and i have seen pictures have you been before yeah i have been before there are good lovely beaches over there you always get a good deal too did you get a good deal yeah yeah i got a good deal 2 weeks all inclusive in alicante what about yourself are you staying with friends we are yes our flights were quite expensive though but i think that is because of the time of year that we are going i would not have thought that they would have been that expensive but we were talking about £600 for a week so quite a lot considering it is only for the flights £600 for flights that is quite interesting yes just for 2 people that is all is robson not going with you no he is going to be staying with his grandparents ah lucky him that is that we are going to have christmas altogether and then afterwards we are going over to see our friends for a while so it has been about 4 years since we have seen them so it will be really nice to no it is long overdue ye yeah so it will be really nice to get over there and see them who else is going away with you is it just you and loida yeah yeah me and loida it will be a good time i am looking forward to it it has been a long time since we went away i think i think when the last time we went was before covid i was trying to work that over i think the last time we went was before covid and unfortunately we have not been able to go anywhere since that is a shame i think a lot of people are in that boat as well you know they have not been able to get away because of covid and various different reasons with working or not so a lot of people are really happy to be getting away again this year it makes a big difference to how you feel when you have got something like that to look forward to does not it well absolutely it changes your mindset completely i always want to have holidays booked and we have had this alicante holiday booked for some time but i think going forward we are probably going to have to make sure that we have at least one holiday booked to look forward to and i have seen the covid rates are going up again this week but hopefully that is just a a a a blip in the road and we can we can continue on as normal absolutely i think it is going to be a bit like that you know throughout the year but probably will peak and then start to drop down again although i guess it just depends on what different people are up to you know lots of people are traveling again lots of people together for the jubilee so i think it just depends on the circumstances for certain people throughout the throughout the months does not it but because we are trying to live with covid now it is that way we have to just use your common sense and wear a mask if you have to go to the shops and if if you are and obviously if you are unwell you would just need to explain to your work i am not sure how it works in terms of time off now and what your eligibility would be if it is just causes another sickness if you would need to have a sick note do you know anything about that then your guidelines to do with work no i do not know anything about it it is so hard to keep a track of it sometimes though i do not doubt though that if it was to affect me i would find out and and do the right thing absolutely you remember that book that grandma used to read to us when we were young called the magic porridge pot yes i do a brilliant book a gre a great scottish book into the the bargain but she used to read it so well what what a brilliant book that was it was i i tried to find it recently at the library when i was there and i could not find it i asked at the desk and they did not actually know which one i was talking about and i was trying to explain it and this storyline i knew it really well actually when i when i was thinking about it but i did have a look on amazon and it was there so i have ordered it and it should be here in a couple couple of days but it was funny because i remember that it is really really well and it is funny the things you remember from your childhood does not it absolutely obviously there was 5 years between us so you will remember certain things that i would not remember as much but i do remember the magic porridge pot getting read to us and again the grandma was such a great storyteller her and grandpa to be honest but certainly they could read the book to keep us and captivated that is it i am really looking forward to getting it because it will give me some really nice memories of them yeah yeah i will be able to pass on about nostalgia as well is not it and the thing is as well you can you can read it to robson and obviously then it becomes a you know almost pass down the the family as such well that is that i can try and recreate it the way that she used to tell it to us with all 3 voices and things yeah you would be doing well it would be as good as grandmother ah well that is that is true experience experience is everything i guess it is yeah it is all it just learning these things and you know these we things that stay in your memory i guess and do not get me wrong it is not something that i routinely remembered but when you mentioned it there i i knew straight away what you were talking about it is interesting is not it because i have not noticed that they have made a cartoon of it quite a lot of the old fairy tales have all been made into cartoons but that one is never been made into cartoon and it is such a nice little story so it would be so nice to be able to watch it as well yeah no i i would absolutely be nice obviously if you have children i am not so sure it has a great selling point other than scotland though and  maybe something that you know it is considered making up here but i am not sure how popular is out with scotland as a story and that is a fair point actually thinking about it i did notice that they are remaking the movie of the little mermaid did you see that 0 really is it a disney production i think it might be but it looks like it might be in real life you know more kind of real life as opposed to animated ah yeah disney are going in a a very different direction i think so t to kinda moving away from the animated side of things not certainly being absolutely animated that they are starting to move away and you know diversify their their films but that has been the last sort of decade or so they have been doing that absolutely it is it is quite interesting though how they are they are remaking these things and sort of bringing it into new era it is quite it is quite good i have not seen yeah i have not seen the beauty and the beast and i know that they remade that i have never watched that or the lion king actually i have not seen them no neither have i and loida went to see beauty and the beast though he said it was very good 0 really it was the one with emma watson was not that okay no i have not had the time to watch them yet but it is definitely something that i should watch because i i love that film as a young child i absolutely loved it absolutely do you remember we used to watch every single week modern lifes homeward bound that is right and i think with that movie it was really different for us because the animals talked remember so we we sort of used to think the animals really could talk and it was that sort of wonder of how did they make the animals do that you know it was i love that that is great yeah we even named our cat after the cat remember 0 what was the name of the cat again sassy yes that is right she was a great cat can you believe she was 22 when she died wow that is old my cat that i had just sadly recently had to be put down and she lived to 14 so to think that she was a whole 8 years older than her is crazy because sydney was really old she showed her age quite quickly you know after a while she was you could tell that she was old she just was not as spritely as she used to be so to think sassy was a whole 8 years older than that as it was always for cats to believe that is right they can they they their health can rapidly decline sadly and it is a shame do you have any pets it is a shame i did have a dog however he also passed away unfortunately he was only young he he was not even 3 years old and he suffered from epilepsy and he suffered very badly from it and he was medicated appropriately however unfortunately he could not really live any longer and he was suffering more or less daily and after consultation with the vet we had to make a decision it is hard decision from one of the certainly one of the hardest decisions of my life but an unselfish one i believe of course that is such a shame i am really sorry to hear that i am sure you had a very good life despite his health issues though i think he made the most of it and we tried to take him as many places as we could and give them everything they wanted or certainly not a dog can want anything but things that we think they would like and we try we try give but un unfortunately that is just life sometimes is not it that is right do you think you will get another pet then i think in due course we will possibly and it is tough right now because he obviously has you know it was only 4 or 5 months ago that he he passed away and you know it leaves such a void but what can you do you know you need to you need to move on at some and maybe one day we will get another dog i am not sure i am not sure sure in terms of me with my cat i mean we obviously had her for 14 years since she was a baby and like we said before her health did rapidly decline quite quickly once we found out that she was unwell so we knew it was the right thing to do is to send her to sleep which was like you know uneasy thing at all because you do not want to lose your pet but you have to look at it from their point of view and what kind of quality of life they have so i think like you we probably will not get any more pets at the moment absolutely it is it play such a massive part in your life and i i think you are almost kinda oblivious to that until you know they are not there anymore and y you realize at the time when you you are looking after them that they they are such a massive part of your life but then when they are not there you realize just how big a part of your life they are and it is it is really difficult sometimes i think when they are not there either that is right we do the they are part of the family and when they are in your life for so long you just get so used to them being there so when they are not it takes such a bit of adjustment to get used to that well that is sad exactly on to happier things and have you tried any new recipes recently now i have actually i tried a really nice spanish potato and chorizo dish recently is that something that you like well that sounds really nice what what do you put in it other than the the main ingredients so i do not know if you have done this before but slow cooked chorizo is actually really really nice it it is you know sometimes when you cook it it can become a little bit tough yeah yeah so i slow cooked it with a tomato based sauce with onions and garlic smoked paprika and then i did the potato separately i chopped them all up parboiled them and then sprayed them with the frylight it is a bit healthier seasoning and put them in the oven and slow cooked the chorizo mixture on low for maybe around 3 hours or so and then basically once the potatoes were ready i took them out and poured the mix over the top and i just served it with couscous and some coleslaw it was quite simple quite easy and r r really really tasted so nice though it was lovely yeah and it sounds healthy as well actually yeah it sounds very nice sounds like something i would eat actually and tell me something did you cook the whole chorizo like as a whole or did you cut it up before you mixed slow cooked it so i chopped it up but i did not chop it up too small because i did not want it to to ove what would be the word go a bit tough you know sometimes when you 0 when you have the chorizo it can do that so the bigger the you leave it the softer it becomes all right okay 0 yeah about that mixture it is like a so is it just a whole chorizo you put in and that is right just chop it up maybe about 2 centimeters something like that into t 2 centimeter pieces and then just pop it in with the the tomato mixture honestly it was really really nice it was quite filling as well so i am always trying to yeah absolutely it sounds it yeah i am always trying to find new recipes when it comes to this time of year because i do not always feel like really big heavy meals you will probably be the same i know absolutely it is the last thing you want is you know a steak pie or something like that you want to have something that is that is quite light and even more easy to eat and you know especially with the rising temperatures recently it is not it is not easy to to have such an appetite especially when it is now more more more humid et cetera y you would probably rather go for that well a mediterranean diet funnily enough that is right what kind of recipes have you been making recently well you know yourself i do not make a lot of things loida tends to cook in this house but really she made a nice tikka pasta recently all right really nice actually it was it was roast chicken with tikka though it and and then all the spices et cetera but it was like a cream based pasta so it it was not too heavy though it was quite nice and especially the way it was made but yeah i i i just want pasta i could i could live on pasta really yeah same here i i do love pasta i have ever told you about the recipe that i make and it is with a balsamic glaze so it is it is more like a sort of it is not like really saucy but it is more of a coating for the pasta and it is made with a bal balsamic glaze that is really nice it should be light as well and not very many you have not told me about that no not very many ingredients i actually used to always go to la vita restaurant and that was the pasta i would always get so i decided to try and recreate it during lockdown last year because we were not able to get there so i ah very nice yeah i found all the ingredients sundried tomatoes mushrooms good quality pancetta smoked or unsmoked whatever you prefer and some absolutely yeah toasted pine nuts and what was that pasta called again nonna pasta ah and what what was in it again was there any meat in it or was it just vegetarian it was good quality pancetta put that in it is really simple actually it is really really simple some garlic cook it all off and add it all together the balsamic glaze works a lot better than the balsamic vinegar because that is just a bit too wet it is too much liquid to to have to try and 0 absolutely yeah yeah thicken it up a bit it is quite interesting it is quite interesting it sounds very nice actually it is it is lovely it is once you try it you would be making it all the time because as i say it is really it is really fresh and really light and it is not too heavy because sometimes pastas can be a bit starchy you know like macaroni cheese i absolutely love that but it can just be so filling and heavy yeah have you ever tried the macaroni cheese from sugo sugo in the town yeah no no no i have not try them d do you know strangely enough i have never been to sugo i absolutely love paesano but i have never been to sugo wow you should definitely go they have all fresh made pasta it is delicious if you love pasta i have heard great things about it if you love pasta you will love it there 0 absolutely i have heard great things of it heard their ragu is very good as well actually i do not think i have tried that from there but it has been a while since i have had a ragu i do really like that at pasta is very good and it is really lovely this time of year we could try and get to sugo at some time you should definitely it is has really good reviews as well i have not been to the pizza place though like you say is it paesano did you say yeah there is one in the town and there is one in the west end as well 0 lovely it is very good it is very m make it obviously fresh for you and it is it is lovely 0 so good all sorts of different toppings on it et cetera you can obviously mix and match and add things to it and take things off et cetera it is lovely really nice is it if the can you choose the different bases or is it all the same no you always it is just a think it is proven sourdough over like 48 hours or something like that but it is the base is so good honestly y you would not want any other base if you tried that wow definitely something i will try then you try the pasta one i will try the pizza one i will let you know how i get on absolutely how is the macaroni there it is really really nice i it is really really nice i i believe it is f 5 different cheeses so it is really cheesy as you can imagine ah okay yeah yeah yeah i ca i can i can imagine

slabs of blue cheese and maybe a snack for her brother bob we also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids she can scoop these things into 3 red bags and we will go meet her wednesday at the train station hi i am my participant number is f c 36 p 2 and the passage reads please call stella ask her to bring these things with her from the store 6 spoons of fresh snow peas 5 thick slabs of blue cheese and maybe a snack for her brother bob we also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids she can scoop these things into 3 red bags and we will meet her wednesday at the train station so here is our conversation i was thinking we should talk about food since i know that we both like food what are some of your favorite foods i do not have favorite specific favorite foods i have favorite countries of of foods i like indian of course italian and i am going through a bit of a japanese phase at the moment how about you yeah i do not think my mom cooked too much indian food when i was growing up there was very western food so i do enjoy eating a curry when i go out i also like italian food of course pizzas pastas sometimes when we feel like eating unhealthy though we like to eat some american style takeout like burgers and those sort of things yeah but i think here south africans do not really eat too much unhealthy food like too much fried stuff as they do in other countries people enjoy barbecues which we call braais what do you enjoy putting on your barbecue chicken is always good but i do love a steak from time to time and of course potato like a baked doing like a baked potato on the coals on the barbecue okay that is nice and how do you like your steaks done well we do a marinade like it is called for short sow so soy sauce olive oil and worces worcestershire sauce yeah and we marinate it in that it is pretty good yeah 0 okay since i i believe it makes it quite tender and soft tender yeah  and do you like it medium then medium rare or just rare medium more medium or well done yeah not not so much juice okay interesting and what do you do on a braai or barbeque yeah i mean it is that is i like lamb choppies or lamb chops they call them do not know if yeah choppies is probably a south african word but yeah i like lamb chops in the braai chicken is also very nice of recent i have been enjoying chicken on the braai and we do this type of sausage here which we call boerewors which is a type of beef sausage but it is long curled up like a snake almost and heavily spiced yes lots of spices in it i do not know what is what is they put coriander  garlic those sort of spices some even put chili in it yeah so that that is quite nice on the braai i am just trying 0 we also enjoy oxtail but then it has to be cooked along it is like a stew on a braai but that is like yeah it has to be about 3 hours or so 4 hours  it is a whole day thing to cook oxtail i was just thinking when you were well i mean when you were a child were did you eat did you you did are there any foods that you did not like eating as a child that you eat now or what sort of foods  did you not like eating as a child so as a child well even now my family never cooked a lot of like a full kind of stuff so kidneys livers that sort of thing we did not eat mutton or lamb either just because and that yeah that that is something i have never been able to acquire a taste for vegetables were pretty much had to eat all our vegetables so i do not have a much of an an aversion for any veggies yeah okay interesting yeah with me i think i am i did not really like mushrooms as a child but now of recent i have started eating mushrooms prawns is what i did not like it too much as a child yeah we never ate that i think the look of them the look of them kinda put you off but now you know now they you find out they are delicious i love mushrooms what sort of dish do you like with mushrooms for the pasta dishes on pizza is very nice even stuffed mushrooms that is also very nice and when you yeah stuff them with cheese and i think bread crumbs  we use bread crumbs so did you grow up by the ocean that you had prawns as a child or were shown prawns as a child yeah i am i grew up on a coastal town so they fish was guys would sell fish on the side of the road on the weekends and see would there would be a fish market and every saturday my father used to go and buy fish fresh fish yeah very different to where i live now i am quite inland so there is not much fish this side what about you yeah i grew up all over but mostly inland in south africa and then a little bit lived a little bit on the coast but i have never enjoyed fish that is something that i struggle to eat it is too fishy yeah okay except prawns i can handle prawns yeah what about hake hake is not too bad it is not too fishy yeah hake is hake is okay okay and 0 yeah i think it is finding bones that is gross there that puts you off yeah i remember there is kids in school who used they used to bring their sandwiches which used to be tinned fish and just have the bones in it and everything in it and they just used to eat it just like that 0 gross without taking out the bones apparently they are soft but anyway that was a bit gross and are you a good cook yeah i would say so i in high school we had home what was home economics so part of that was practical cooking and so in the final year of high school i won the i got the highest marks for practical the as practical aspect of the subject sure that is good for the for the grade the theoretical i was not too good with but but yeah practical i got the highest mark for sure what was the did you have that subject in school yeah but only the girls took it girls not a lot of boys yeah so it was just girls took that subject it was called home economics huh what was the project that you had to make what dish that you had to make for your where you scored your high marks well it was throughout the year so it was different different things made for the different aspects of cooking so it could be like if it was confectionery so it could be marshmallows or honeycomb or sugar sweets or so it was throughout marks gotten throughout the year for the different aspects hm what are sugar sweets i have never heard of them before sugar sweets like a sparkle like 0 so they what do they call them now are they called what are they called like those menthols we we used to get yeah a sugar sweet no they called them something else i can not remember now no idea i need some research on that and would you ever think of becoming a vegetarian have you ever tried it yeah for a few months maybe 6 months or so went vegetarian okay and how did it go yeah i did well it just requires a lot more planning and like thinking out of the box it is much easier to prepare a meat and 2 veg kinda meal than it is to prepare a vegetarian meal so it just requires a lot more planning and thinking which you do not always have time to do that yeah and also people think you save money by eating vegetables the the price of vegetables are actually the same price as meat things are expensive yeah and what about you do you not come from a vegetarian background heritage yeah they they were supposed to be vegetarian but they never practiced it i do not think any of that family on on my side actually practice the vegetarian traditions it is hard to be a vegetarian in south africa because the meat is so good yeah  i did try to be a vegetarian once where i saw this thing on the tuli elephants being abused it was on tv it was a documentary and then in protest i was for a month i did not eat vegetables so yeah that is yeah vegetarian being a vegetarian is quite hard you really took your stand yeah it was terrible how they were beating them because they had to they have to beat them when they are training them  it was terrible and do you eat a meal everyday like all 3 meals like breakfast lunch supper or do you skip meals no i eat all 3 meals i am not a i am not a huge snacker so i stick to the 3 meals a day and what are you what do you like for for for breakfast then breakfast is pretty simple just a big mug of coffee and some toast with peanut butter hm okay sounds good and lunch whatever is going if there is leftovers or a sandwich you do not care too much about lunch no it is not breakfast and lunch are not important meals in my opinion supper or dinner is the most important meal hm and how many cups of coffee then do you have every day just 11 cup of coffee and then a cup of tea in the afternoon and then some herbal tea at night okay and what sort of tea do you like in the in the for your 2nd cup i mean your the one after coffee so we have 5 roses tea it is just like a normal ceylon tea black tea tea yeah and like it is a good strong cup of tea okay and then with tea do you have a biscuit or something like a hobnob i do not rea often keep biscuits at home but if i have baked something then yeah i would have something with it  what is your favorite biscuit you are obviously a fan i like jaffa cakes they are quite hard to find though because i think they are imported we have our own brand here who makes that here one of the supermarket pick n pay 0 okay has their own brand and then romany creams are nice it is that bakers bake it is it is an oats or it is made with oats or chocolates i think so and then what about a chocolate digestive no i was not too much into those digestives yeah not too much into digestive i liked its shortbread style ones the eet sum mor is i think this was it scottish shortbread what did they call it i do not know what the official name for it yeah shortbread yeah and so you do not have cereals you do not like cereals in the morning no i have not yeah cereals i stopped eating when i was a kid and then i stopped eating breakfast altogether i have never been a breakfast eater i just could not eat anything in the mornings before like 11 or 12 i had to force myself to start eating in the mornings hm sure and what is your wherever you live and stuff well what is your favorite restaurant at the moment do you like going out to restaurants yeah sometimes it can be a bit disappointing because sometimes you can do better at home yourself what what is a favorite restaurant at the moment we have a restaurant by us that does a a monday night burger special so you buy one and get one free so i am pretty partial to a good deal so whatever restaurant is having a good deal is probably would be where i would go okay yeah the buy one get one free that is always a good deal it is always a winner are there any like indian restaurants by you there is one but i have never i have not tried it yet okay chinese no no chinese french yes there is a lady in the town that is a a french baker she is from the reunion island so she makes french pastries and stuff that is that is pretty good 0 i was going to ask you about so the burger special that is that is a good one yeah buy one get one free do have you yeah so what did you have for dinner tonight pasta  just like a pas pasta dish yeah and you you know i had also a pasta dish and but with pork sausages you know so that was quite nice interesting so did your mom teach you to cook or your dad no not really so much my dad never cooked my mom she did cook but she did not teach me really but when i got older i realized i needed to learn so then i started learning yeah so now i enjoy it i enjoy cooking so is that something cultural culturally would would a mom teach a son an indian mother teach her son to cook or not really no it is not not really yeah it is not really socially social socially acceptable you know because it is quite a a society where you know the woman is expected to cook so that that is a problem so that is why many and i because i was a high school teacher so i used to tell my kids all the guys especially i just say to them you must learn how to cook because you can impress a girl if you cook for them if you make dinner for them and if you cook for them so it gave them some good life skills that they needed to learn so what grades did you teach i taught grades 8 to 12 so that is 12 is like matric which is the final year of high school so yeah i taught english literature so it was novels and poetry shakespeare the usual stuff you know  which the kids hated and what movies did you do for film study we did life of pi which is quite an interesting movie yeah and then the crucible i do not know if you have watched that one about those girls  who accuse all those people of being witches yeah it was quite an interesting one i am trying to think now 0 but the shakespeare is i always showed them the movies because they battle to understand so we showed them like hamlet and they loved hamlet for some reason because i think it just starts off with killings and murders and bloodshed so the kids kids love that yeah but they battled with shakespeare that was tough for them hm and what what was your favorite book in school that you did i did we did a lot of south african literature  so in the last year of high school i did a book called shades what was that about can you remember i do not think we do that in our school i think it was about it was about a a white family a white kid that grows up and befriends a a black child that works on the farm so it was all most of the literature that we had got in school is a around that sort of topic because of apartheid hm so yeah that was yeah what it was about shades yeah so we we also did  lord of the flies hm that was good the kids liked that one especially the boys that is they can imagine that happening if so being an english teacher are you an avid reader not really i enjoy movies more than than books yeah so definitely watching movies i always told the kids i was an avid reader just to make them read but it was actually an untruth a lie so what movies do you enjoy watching firefly you know star wars star trek yeah sci fi but i like off beat like dark sci fi you know and it is not so happy and then i like thrillers and whodunits murder mysteries and yeah 0 we love british series yeah i love that what do you like yeah yeah also a mur murder mystery kinda ones any any detective crime solving shows you know documentaries i like documentaries i am not a big fan of sci fi or fantasy kind of movies okay but sometimes it is also good just to watch a comedy or romantic comedy something that is a bit like mind numbing so you do not have to put much thought into what you are watching 0 so i call it chewing gum for the eyes  so it is like chewing gum for the eyes so you just watch it through that yeah what is what is your last british series that you have really enjoyed i think you were telling me once about line of duty 0 yeah yes yeah line of duty was very gripping british series are like more gripping than american series yeah they are and i like they give yeah the the ones where you have to just like stay up and watch the entire season yeah you have to binge but the nice thing is about british ones as well they only make 4 or 5 episodes  some american series are like 18 go on and on yeah like lost that series yeah and did you have any pets growing up many so our 1st pet was so we have always had dogs cats my mum became a bit of a collector of cats so she would any cat that she would find strays she would come home with so we had a lot of cats and hamsters my sister always had rabbits which i did not really like they are always ki kickers and yeah what else we always we grew up in a bit of like a a rural kind of area where there was a bit more wildlife than you would get in the city so we would sometimes get like a dassie we once had a baby dassie what is the other name for was that i think like it is a rock rock badger rock hyrax rock yeah so we had that and then i hand reared a mongoose yeah hm  what was the mongoose is name mongey and what type of what you know what species species it was a slender mongoose so it is like a very long thin body long tail and like a rusty rusty kind of color fur and what happened to mongey well it was we found my parents found it its mom had been chased off by a dog and they waited for the mom to bring it back to come back and get it she did not so we hand li it had injured injured its back leg so we kept it in an old hamster cage until and fed it until it got stronger we released it but it just it obviously had gotten used to us so it did not go so it lived like our cats it would jump in and out of the window and go out and come back and go out and then there was they are very territorial so there was a wild one that also lived around the house and they were always fighting over the territory and then the after having it for maybe 3 years 3 or 4 years the wild one killed it and our alsatian who was like a mother she mothered everything she found found it and brought its body back to the house to show us sure shame fair day and how long did you have mongey for yeah it must have been about 3 or 43 it must have been yeah maybe 4 or 5 years okay 0 we just got a message from zoom meeting will end in 9 minutes 9 minutes okay so that is sure that is sad and so did you have pets there was always dogs it was never anything so exotic like yours like cats no i did not like cats you are not a cat person no what about or you just do you still feel have you never been around cats yeah i have one kind of adopted as which we grew close to but yeah not definitely not by choice getting a cat yeah i would like if i could have a dog again but the area where i live does not allow dogs we were you watching that did you see have you seen those videos on social media at the moment about those dogs that apparently communicate with the owners what do you think about that yeah so you can see in a lot of the videos the owners like making their own interpretation of what what buttons the dog has pressed there is far easier ways to communicate i mean animals do not communicate in words obviously hm so yeah there is other ways of communicating with your pets than getting them to press buttons and trying to humanize what you think they are thinking yeah i think it is just the the tone that you use there so that that you give instructions in it is not so much the words hm yeah strange people are funny so how come what area do you stay in that you can not have pets well it is also quite a rural area and the the problem is they have leopards here and other wild animals so we can not have a pet because it will be the leopard is lunch or supper and there is no fences as well to protect your wild animals i mean your domestic pets from your the wild animals around i think there is even in the neighboring place to where we are there is lions there even so but they are just separated by an electric fence so they could actually just push through if they wanted hm but that is what people think about africa when they think about it they think lions are just walking around and they actually are but they have electric fences to protect them s so certain areas yeah yeah it would be nice to have a pet again so how long have you lived where you are currently about 3 years now 3 years yeah so i was on the coast and i have moved inland so yeah it is it is quite a nice little town very small town it is one of these you call it a 11 was it one horse town one horse so there is not much to do lots of foreigners yeah we have british tourists yeah tourists that is because it is close to one of the a big safari park kind of thing and then the area where we live we have made friends with some british american families yeah so there is quite a mix of people here so which safari park is it nearest it is called the kruger national park so it is quite a famous one i think whenever someone comes to south africa they g go to the have to go to the kruger national park and do you go often yeah i like to go at least once a month it is about an hour maybe but the problem is petrol is getting so expensive because of this the world conditions at the moment so yeah we may have to even limit traveling once a month because you you use a lot of petrol because you are pretty much just driving the whole day hm you can even do sometimes like 500 ks or something in there sure 500 kilometers not meter not miles just looking for animals so do you miss the coast yes i miss my friends at the coast i i think there was more to do socially at the coast although this area is quite beautiful with nature i think there is a lot of more interesting restaurants more things to do more friends yeah that sort of thing so yeah i miss that aspect of the cost it is also nice to know that you are at the edge when you are inland it is claustrophobic you know because you feel so yeah but at the coast you know you had to do something at the end but they have had i think 2 or 3 months ago they have had terrible flooding there in that area  and so far friends were affected as well by that and lots of people died there so they have not been having a really great time there  yeah so and what about work wise what did you do for work so i studied interior design and then i went into law so i was slightly rela related field so i was battling to get work in the interior design field so yeah i started out working for a law firm so it was specializing in property law and i did that for 1012 years 10 or 12 years and then i left work and i focused on volunteer work and then eventually my husband and i started an online store selling men is ties and accessories 0 interesting and how is that how is that business going yeah it is doing much better with the covid and lockdowns and everything people were not it was mainly weddings that we did so people were not getting married  but as soon as that lifted then it went back to normal so yeah it is doing pretty well okay interesting so covid had an effect on that so in in the area i live as well because it is based on tourism well that is their primary source of income the people are game rangers  so a lot of companies closed down here during covid so covid really had a negative effect on people here  so yeah that is quite tragic so a lot of these nice businesses had to close down i think we got one minute maybe you should end it and start again okay i will speak to you just now okay (EDACC-C43_P1)

her brother bob we also need a small plastic snake and bi and a big toy frog for the kids she can scoop these things into 3 red bags and we will go meet her wednesday at the train station there you go great great okay i like your accent you have a a british accent really actually i think my accent changed a lot throughout the years because at 1st i was studying in english in the university and so i felt that was my best moment in in english and then when i went back to living home you know i am surrounded by native speakers of my own language and so i i feel like my eng my english actually has worsened a lot so thank you  yeah you know but i still try to watch lot of movies in all the languages i speak so that i try to keep it up you know because i am always worried you know that i know it it is so easy i think to forget a language and so you always have to try to keep it going on somehow so i just watch a lot of netflix i guess yeah a and do you do you speaks with other people in english no not at all like not at all it is just you know sometimes i text my friends like international friends from the uni or whatever and so that that is the only time i get to speak english or maybe when i am traveling but that is not very often nowadays so yeah but i yeah this is why i am not practicing as much as i would like to and so just persevering so there is that i see  a and wh did not you you said you you went to malta yes yes for holidays yes when when was it last last month i think so i think it was last month it was in yeah it was in may now it is in june so like yeah roughly last month but it was lovely and there people spoke perfect english like and even though that that is not their 1st language i think their 1st language is ma maltese like it is a weird combination of arab and and like and italian and and spanish so that is a weird language but they they do speak very nice english so it was very nice have you gone on holiday anywhere recently no not recently  i think the last yeah time i went i went on holiday was in 2019 no well i i i went i went to i went to the beach in 2020 but it is just for a day and you know i have not i have not been on holiday so when when you that is bad we can go somewhere together yeah we we we can arrange it when you when you went to malta did they ask you for a vaccination passport or or anything like that i think like one month ago it was yes you had to you had not you have to compile like a file which is i do not remember the name but it is a thing that you have to do every time you travel anywhere in the european union stating like what is the state the the state of your vaccination and and saying how it work like where are you going basically so just to track you down which is not super nice if you think about it but anyway  and then and then to go on the plane actually you had to be vaccinated but that is not a thing anymore i am not sure now i am pretty sure you do not have to wear a mask on the plane anymore so there is that but i am not sure what is like the if you have to be vaccinated to fly or something i have no idea of anything anymore so it is this form that you have to to fill in is it is it an online form yeah it is an online form it is it is from the website of the european union and it is called something like a passenger yeah passenger location form that is the name and like i if you are going anywhere in the european union you just may fill this thing up and and that is just for the european union to know like where you are and what is your vaccination stat status i think i think i am not sure okay but do you did they do not ask you they do not ask you to a proof of of this form when you board the plane or when you have to buy the ticket no they do not ask they are 2 separate things there are 2 you have to do this thing i do not know why they tell you like if you go on on the website of the plane of the plane company they tell you please fill this form at this link ta da da but no one check this but even in the worst period of covid like you had to fill so many forms but no one checked anything i remember so when covid hit i i i was living abroad and i had to go back home and a and i had to fill when when i took the plane to go home i had to fill so many forms so many like i had so much paperwork and no one checked anything at all nothing and it is just like and and i remember like here in the worst time of covid every ti every time we went out you had to go out with the paper stating the the reason why you were going out but it never happened to me a single time to be checked on those papers just paper waste if you ask me  but anyway yeah so whe where would you like to go next in vacation on vacation i saw a €71 flight to baleares so there is that you want to come with me you s you saw or you you bought a flight no i just saw it i have not bought it yet because the thing is all the 0 and i was like €70 baleares i mean but all the hotels are fucking ex sorry 0 the language all the hotels are so expensive extremely expensive is it in sp is it in spain yeah it is like the baleares islands yeah not the ones in the in the atlantic ocean the one in the mediterranean  yeah i i think they are under like barcelona or something yeah in that area between anyways spa spain and and morocco and and this is and this seems to be pretty but like the hotels are really really really expensive and so what is the point of spending just €70 for the flight but then you are going to spend too much i am talking €600 for the shittiest 0 for a very bad hostel so that is a lot what  for how how many how many nights how many nights like like okay one week but that is like €600 for a bad hostel i mean wow i am not spending that kind of money to sleep  with with other 6 people i can do that for free you know what i am saying anyway so yeah i am low key looking for a different no i do not know what you mean what what what what yeah i am feeling just a stupid way  0 my anyway yeah yeah so that is that is i i i was and and then actually my sister god bless her like and i was like 0 you know i saw this crazy cheap flight i want to buy it and she was like yeah but check the hotels 1st they are they are going to be so expensive it is baleares in july and i was like naaaah and i go check the hotels and i was like ooh and it is bad so yeah  i am still looking at the flight and i actually i low key moved a work thing i had to do because so badly i wanted to take the flight so now the work thing is moved and i still have not found a hotel and so i do not know yeah do you have a do you have an exhibition no i i have a workshop i am making like a cycle of workshop actually tonight already i have the 1st workshop and then every saturday for like 5 weeks i am making one in yeah so doing that 0 nice so yeah how many people are in this workshop tonight and so are you are you are you hosting the work workshop yeah yeah yeah not in my not in my place but i i am going to be a guest in in a shop and in this actually this is the place where i did my my exhibition and so i will be a guest and i will hold the workshop at their place and and then you know i just talk about you know teach things and talk about work and today it is 3 people so we are low key hoping for bigger numbers but you know i am doing something ho ho how many people i mean we were aiming for like 78 so  a actually last week the the fir the very 1st workshop was actually last week but it got canceled because there were not enough actually there were 2 people and i said i was going to do it but then one of the 2 people bailed and so it was the only one person and yeah  but they did not this the one person but how but ho how how did they pro how did they promote this event eh on social media at their shop but i mean i think these people i do not know they are also getting the thing is i am collaborating for work with a lot of people that are starting just like me and so a and so it the the thing that is hard with this thing is that we are all trying to get each other visibility but this is not how it work in order to get visibility you have to be like a known person  but these other people also are still relatively unknown so if 3 pages i do not know on instagram with 1000 follower each promote each other it is still 3000 followers which is not a lot and you know you have in in social media you need big numbers in order to achieve i do not know real engagement because because like if if 3000 people sees that like ev like it is a very small percentage of the people that follow you that are actually interested but like actively interested like i am going to buy this i am going to do that and that is very low percentage and so yeah you need you need people with higher follower count like for example recently i have done a collaboration with an artist and she has 50 k and that is nice but even from the and i did this collaboration with this artist specifically because of her high follower count because yes i wanted to do the collaboration but the collaboration has to happen because i want to have some visibility you know with them and so but even from this lady who has 50 k followers on instagram i only got a couple of 100s of follower more on my page so yeah that is very low percentage of engagement and this is something i am struggling with honestly i see i do not know and it is annoying to be struggling about these things because they are not important things you know what i am saying like having to worry about a follower count is just something sterile it is not something you know that is just boring and but it it but the thing is it actually change thing in the work because if the majority of your work comes from instagram like having a a high follower count actually will change something in your work and that is yeah that is just the way it works i see when i was living in florence i i was i was working for for a restaurant that they used to do cooking courses ah ah so so they they used airbnb to promote to promote this course okay airbnb yes because in airbn on airbnb there is a section called experiences huh so also the house can or can organize these events and then you know can can do v very different things for for example guided tours or cooking classes or wine tasting and they are very they are very popular especially because the the target of these the of the airbnb is local people who are traveling in the location so you can promote your your business in in in the local area so it is not it is not just let us say like instagram deletes i do not know it people from other countries can can see your w what you do but also for for pe for local people who are in that yeah yeah the tourists yeah people that are that are interested in in things to do in that area so i mean i am talking about the workshops maybe you can can think about also that channel i do not know if they probably charge you a percentage of how much you charge so i mean  yeah but it is just a it is just a way to to have you know some i do not know some reviews or any anyway just people that come to your workshop and yeah some something like that that could be an idea also couch surfing couch surfing also couch surfing yeah you can promote like an event or an event but but i think actually airbnb works best because the kind of tourism that is developing in my area right now i do not think it is couch surfing tourism i think right now we are having a lot of like you know i am not supposed to say the name of the countries but neighboring countries you know what those are and like the richer ones okay and and so and this is like a spec a sp like sport kind of tourism people who come here to do with you know bi the bike the bike tourism is exploding right now here and and so like these are people with like also older people you know what i am saying like fi in their 50s 60s so i think actually i i will look into airbnb because it is a great idea because i have been looking for ways to promote my workshops  and that is actually very interesting but maybe now i will also check that one too because actually i have been working also with the tourism office but honestly they have been kind of useless so yeah yeah yeah the thing i learned is that if you want to promote something like go to the authorities because like you have to do that but do not expect them to actually do something because 90% of the time the authorities the official channels or whatever they are going to be useless i do not know what what they are paying them for but anyway so like but like working with private organizations these people are what those who get things done yeah definitely but yeah so airbnb seems sounds like a very interesting idea thank you yeah you are welcome so what else  0 and yesterday was my sister birthday party so we had pizza and our grandmas came over and we had dinner and i 0 did i 0 this is a tragical news did i told you and i think i told you i am lactose intolerant what what does it mean i cannot eat mozzarella anymore wha ho how do you know 0 because i was feeling sick every time i ate cheese and but actually i did not know right it took a lot of time because at 1st i thought it was just a stressful period and you know some people you know when they are stressed they ha have headaches and and i always was the kind of person when he is stressed gets a little bit sick in the stomach but then this thing kept going and so i was like okay maybe i should see try different things and see if there is something specifical that makes me sick right yeah and so i realized that it was the cheese and so i cannot eat any more cheese or or or milk and that is a hassle because like like you cannot imagine no one has lactose free mozzarella like all the supermarkets have it they all have it it is super common but the restaurants do not so like you are going to go to a restaurant and you are like 0 do you have lactose free mozzarella and they are going to be like they are going to look at you like you asked if if and i know if if you have unicorns meat or something yeah and they are like i am sorry i do not have well i do not like cheese unicorn meat so it is not would not be a problem for me you just do not eat mozzarella i i i i i do not like cheese but i i do eat pizza i like pizza but i do not i do not with mozzarella the regular one i do not but i do not yes i do not i do not eat cheese i do not eat parmesan cheese i only eat other other kind of cheese i do not just like it that is that is always confusing to me because i am if you remember when i 1st met you you were in your i think vegan phase so i i and so i just kind of got used to the idea of you were vegan and then several years later you were like no actually i eat meat and then i feel like i can never keep track of what yeah because it change i because i change i i change my habits i know it you told me yeah and then and then now like i learn that you do not eat cheese but it is just no it is just i do not like i do not like cheese that is yeah but it is still crazy because like how do you like cheese anyway i just i just said goodbye to my uncle he came from from the country i was born  yeah he left i think he left today okay he came here with with my aunt and they came here in egypt because my my grand daddy is not very is not very well and so they wanted yeah you told me yeah and so they they want to say goodbye to him and then yeah and i i grew up with with him i well i did not grow up i i stayed with him for about a year when i was when i was 7 okay yeah so we spent a lot of time with him he taught me how to play chess okay and yeah it was a a bit sad to to say goodbye he is he is a very nice person okay he is a yeah he is he is a painter and also a teacher a painter yeah 0 i never knew that what does he paint he paints mostly surrealistic things okay but the the main thing is the erotic scenes okay okay but no not erotic just not no not erotic just he paints a lot of women but okay just the the shape or or you know it is not it is not very detailed face okay okay okay yeah but that is interesting actually that is that is very yeah i i i then from what you are telling me that is i i would like to see his work it is it sounds very interesting but does he actually sell the paintings and everything like he does he just earn something of it or is it just for fun no no he he he sells his paintings yeah okay and like he also teaches at the university ah the university in my hometown yes ah no i no actually i think he is some kind of director of of studies at the university i do not know okay yeah but he was here he is he has been active for i do not know how many years okay wow mad respect fellow artist i like that yeah okay yeah so my also my another aunt is coming is coming soon okay okay probably for the same reason okay yeah well that is a bit sad though i am so i i am sorry about your grandpa though 0 it is it is okay he is he is being taken care of okay that is good to hear yeah my mom is taking care of him  and what about your grandparents 0 well well yeah i i will still have only my 2 grandmothers actually but basically like my grandma she is very funny because every year she will say this is the last year i am alive this time around it is going to get me you know it is i am going and we are like no grandma that is not true and she has been saying this for like 15 years so you know so and she is like 0 i just want to live one more year so and like you can insert i do not know life event i do not know i just want to see this person graduation i would just be so happy if i could live one year so that i can see this and that wedding i i just have to see their wedding and then i can die but it has been this she she keeps going strong so how how old is she i think she is 89 she is yeah she is 89 at this point so 0 no yeah 89 in in 2 months actually so and then she started saying i just want to live until i am 90 and and with i am pretty sure she is going to make to a a 110 at least at least and she is still she is the thing is she is still cheeky you know like she has a lot of you know pain and back pain and she does not walk very well but she has a ongoing fight with her neighbor and like every time we mention her neighbor she starts cussing it is crazy like she says she is so candid about you know her opinion and everything she will say she she she really has no filter she says whatever because like she does not give yeah yeah she does not care she does not care at all and and then like for example yesterday my father and mother they wanted to go on their they were supposed to go on a weekend away right and they did not know and they go in the car and did not know if they wanted to leave yesterday evening after my sister is birthday or if they wanted to go in early in the morning but eventually my father was like no no let us let us go in the evening that is better so like we already waking up you know where we are so okay and then my grandma was like no but you have to drive in the evening and so afterwards so my grandma leaves and when she is leaving she is she is like to my father ha you did not behave very well and we were like huh why grandma why did you say this like you are not listening to me i said you were supposed to leave in the morning and you are not listening you are still leaving in the evening so you know she expressed her opinion very strongly and that is actually it is fine because she will say like i mean this is just a a a a fun example but she is she will say things and that you totally do not expect and she will say them like super simultaneously and and it is very fun to see so yeah yeah have you been to edinburgh actually i have never been there yeah it is very beautiful i have been there for about a week no it is not one week for a few for a few days okay and it was it was really nice i mean the weather is is very is not very good but i was lucky i i we had a sunny day okay and we went on a hike on a moun on a hill called arthur is seat okay i think it is named after king arthur i believe and i am not sure okay and from that point you could you could see well the whole city you could see you could also see the i think the sea or i i think the sea or or the river and it and it is very beautiful and it is it is a very i do not know it is a it it it it is it is you can i mean you can see the the the whole landscape it is okay it it is i think it is a very i do not know i i remember i have this feeling of like wilderness and and and and and the city altogether because you know this there is this massive rock they call the arthur is seat and it is i mean the the view from there was nice and it was a very sunny day it was the only sunny day we had the rest of the time was just raining all the time okay but the city itself is very beautiful it is the buildings are are very beautiful and yeah it was it was very very nice all right did we hit the number the the word number like the the time number sorry like i think it of how long have you our are we supposed to speak i think like i do not remember if it is 20 minutes or 30 at this time 0 it is it is 30 minutes but i think we s ah we started we started i think 2 minutes where i probably we are almost 30 minutes into the recording because i i started okay okay the recording i think probably 2 minutes after 0 we can still we can talk 2 minutes more but and about edinburgh actually edinburgh i think edinburgh edinburgh yeah edinburgh yeah yeah this is a very weird pronunciation but actually a friend of mine has been to scotland and i this is the thing i actually heard very like different things about scotland like some people have been there like and they told me just like you said the nature is amazing and like told me amazing things but like i and and this friend of mine who actually felt extremely negative ne negatively of scotland because she w she was like there with her family and and the and the she said it like all the the pla like the eating places closed very very early and like she is a late dinner like she she she usually dine at 9 p m which i think it is very late even from our country yeah and and and like and she complain that like it they always close like like their restaurant they would just close but like everything at 8 p m and like really and yeah i do not know this is what she told me so i do not know well i do not know and i do not know maybe it depe depends on did she say edinburgh or it was another town general general generally scotland because she has been traveling around scotland that that is one holiday that many years ago okay that is when when she was like probably like 13 or 12 so and she is my age so we are talking about like yeah i do not know how old i am yeah well 15 years ago so that is but like this is i remember there was like this one very strong negative opinion about scotland like and like and everyone c everything closed so early and and she she and she could not eat and also the thing is that she had she no i think she actually was already 18 so we are talking maybe 810 years ago but the thing is her sister she has a younger sister and this sister was like 12 at the time and she could not go into pubs because the pub have like an age limit you know you can you have to be 18 or more and so the only open places were the pubs but since the sister could not get in no one could get in of course in the family and and so several times they actually like just could not get dinner or they had they had to get dinner at like some you know fast food like yeah just something very quick because they could not eat so and and she said this is why she did not like scotland but other people actually told me that it is like solo travelers and actually all the actually this is the thing all the solo travelers that have been to scotland they told me very positive things so so there is that maybe yeah it is not the frie friendly place i do not know i do not know pr i do not remember that they closes so early because i remember i met a i met a friend at at the bar i guess was a bar okay and it was late at night and she she is a best pastry chef 0 she 0 i do not know she is still living in edinburgh but she was a pastry chef and so after okay work they went to this to this club and then we get in very late after they finish work so probably after after 12 i i assume that they they were there and there you know there was still a lot of people and yeah but i but it is a bar that is not a restaurant the thing is the problem is the restaurants 0 okay like not bars or pu like of course bars and pubs are okay but not the restaurants this is what i was told by my friend at least so i do i i this is not my firsthand opinion so i do not know okay okay i think we can we can stop the recording now okay okay okay all right so let me let me stop this okay yes (EDACC-C54-00)
hi my participant number is f c 60 p one please call stella ask her to bring the things with her with her from the store 6 spoons of free fresh snow peas 5 thick slabs of blue cheese and maybe a snack for her brother bob we also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids she can scoop these things into 3 red bags and we will go meet her wednesday at the train station okay my participant is number is f c 60 p 2 and now it is my turn please call stella ask her to bring these things with her from the store 6 spoons of fresh snow peas 5 thick slabs of blue cheese and maybe a snack for her brother bob we also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids she can scoop these things into 3 red bags and we will go meet her wednesday at the train station perfect okay right that was perfect okay please i have a question for you if you could go on holidays anywhere where would you go and why now at the moment i think i would choose the greek island maybe just because i heard some nice comments and tips from my friends who have been there before about the weather and people and also about the food so i would pick greek or maybe italy from the south side i had friends living there last summer they said that the people nearby there is not that courteous people but instead of people we have amazing landscapes such as the beaches in puglia you know so i think a mix of nice landscapes and nice weather it would be great to pick now a trip necessary yeah necessary for the time i think i need to chill a little bit i am already 3 years here and no holidays in those times so yeah i need to chill have drinks and make some sun bath at the beach you know yeah this is necessary yeah but tell me which one will you pick i know that you are just you are in a trip now but yeah will you pick yeah just i do not know i am i am happy where i am now asia has been nice i am discovering a new culture new type of food the food here is amazing like thai food and chinese it is it is unreal really is that like people say really spicy food there yeah actually it is like i bought a sauce okay and it says like extra mild and it is so so spicy like everything i do not know what they what for them is like is spicy you know like or mild i i do not i do not know like everything is everything has something spicy so it is interesting yeah but they use a lot of spicy here because it is it is very warm okay and they use that for cooling cooling them down becau because it is too too hot the whole day so it is kind of understandable why they use so much spicy food sorry so much spicy and yeah so i am very how do you say it is amazing here you know but i have been talking with my boyfriend and i it is it has been difficult to live here because the culture is so different than in europe or in south america like for instance the the religion is one of the things that it is it is it has shocked me the most because there is so much muslim people you know and like it is totally different than i ever thought you know what i mean like i have never been here with like for example the they pray every 5 days i think 5 days 5 times a day sorry so you can hear like the mosques you can hear them praying or playing music you know so that is kind of a stuff is like 0 my god that is crazy you know or also the the woman wear their 5 times a day pardon 5 times in a day they are praying they they are like having break during work to pray yeah yeah actually they have praying rooms in many places so people go to pray there it is crazy that is why it is like 0 my god yeah it is it is just extremely difficult extremely different so of i ever seen in my life before yeah so yeah but i am i am really happy because the landsca landscapes are amazing beautiful leaf forest so it rains a lot as well and yeah i like it i really like it amazing what type of food do you can i ask you something else tell me 0 sorry i was about to ask you something else tell me well i was going to ask if i know that you have been abroad for a a long time now right yeah and all the countries you have been before which one is your favorite do you have one favorite and why yes i have one ireland is my favorite ireland okay yes it is the most beautiful country in the world i have a special connection with the land and okay yeah i dreamt a lot about ireland before going there i lived there 3 years and i still feel the same connection than the 1st time i think i probably lived before in past life there or okay i do not know i was meant to be there but i feel the connection with the land and also i think the landscapes are unique you know there is it is so rocky yeah they are so many cliffs you know you know because you live there so yeah and the weather is amazing as well like i do not like hot weather what about you do you like hot weather i like the hot weather i got used with the weather here it is totally different like from my home country right yeah but i do not know it is like i am really enjoying now the sunny days we are having here but i know it is for a short time you know as in 3 months but it is okay it is nice one thing that kinds annoy me is that we have such a long day like the sunset is 1010 p m so for me it is like i i got lost in my time schedule yeah because for me is it still day it still like 5 p m because i still have sun in the sky yeah but no it is like 10 p m it is fine it is so weird is not it but at least you have ever like maybe the the day seems longer you know that is good yeah the day seems longer but yeah it is a bit confusing for me but it is fine i understand i understand and what about food what is your favorite food now that i am now that i am far away from my country and i can say that my favorite food would be every food my mom cooks aww that is so cute but in a way thinking that my family comes from the countryside right  so especially a lot of vegetables grains like beans and rice all that kind of stuff with a lot of seasoning but not spice please i can not handle spice because i got to i start sweating a lot if i am eating spice and i like to enjoy 0 my god i understand the food i do not like to be like 0 my god i am going to burn here no all sweaty the sweat on your body ugh yeah i dislike yeah yeah that is the thing i i the thing i most miss i am missing hearing in ireland is this about the the food and the vegetables that we have a lot in the other countries and here it is kind of limited you know  it is always peppers peppers potatoes and peppers and that is it 0 my god yeah but it is nice i can get to used of this and when i am missing too much some recipe i can try to reproduce them here so yeah it is not a big deal it is not i think i can find ways to you know yeah to and do you do you like normalize do you buy food in the in the supermarket mostly yeah yeah mostly in the supermarkets now i am getting the restaurant because i work in the restaurants right  but i am used to cook my own food not spend money like getting takeaways 1st because i am a student 2nd because it is kind of always the same thing and i like to get a lot of options you know yeah i understand i understand do you have a favorite type of food i not really i no i like different kind of i i do not know i do not have a favorite to be honest i enjoy the food that i feel in the moment for example here in where i am now in asia i enjoy more fresh food for example because i it is very hot so you need something fresh like salad or vegetables you know fruits that is amazing cause here there are so many fruits in ireland i used to crave more potatoes because it is offered the most there and like fried stuff you know cause it is cold and you need fat and fat basic i am vegetarian so it is it is been difficult to have to get protein okay and all the tofu and other type of like protein sources vegetarian sources are very common here like beans lentils chickpeas and stuff so i try to buy this stuff from the supermarket and add it into my salad and now also my boyfriend has problems with gluten so we want to become more gluten free and also this is also a big challenge here cause like gluten free stuff are not common because people do not suffer from celiac diseases here probably or we think it because like they do not use so much bread it is not like in europe or in south america that we use a lot of bread here is more vegetables fruits and grains these type of grains that are not so common no it is not wheat you know so it is sorry it is it is it is there is wheat included but not in like in this format you know so we have to be very careful with what we buy now we had to change we cannot like go to a restaurant and buy the same food that others buy because it could be contaminated by wheat and stuff you know so yeah yeah it is a huge challenge and we are going to try to do our best yeah it is it is difficult yeah but it is possible yeah i know like what for example i am working in a restaurant now and we have not full menu and and not even like 50% of the menu but i can say like around 30% of the options are gluten free due to this celiac disease people face here  and we are work i think brands they are working to improve this kind of options for customers because now we have an increased number of vegetarians and vegans and also about increased number of celiac disease as well so people are being more responsible about what they are eating or choosing to eat yeah so that is nice i think brands are working to get there and offer more options to to customers because brand is like more to give an experience than they just sell the product right yeah so this restaurant i am working now i think they are on their the right way for example have a vegan and vegetarian menu main menu that is let us say the common and normal menu with all the steps for people who does not have any disease does not have problems with dairy products or celiac products you know and but also have the options for everybody because we want to offer food that everybody can eat and have a great experience and taste another another flavor from another country you know yeah for example here in ireland it is really common in other restaurants people order their main course and some chips the french fries as a side  but at the restaurant i am working the italian restaurant we do not have chips and people get shocked when we say we do not have chips here 0 really that is so weird  yeah exactly but yeah it is we have like options that you can substitute you can choose instead chips you can get some crunch nice things that so it is vegetarians vegan celiacs and dairy restrictions diets so it is really nice awesome and and do you do you do you get to some vegetarian dishes or you are with by sorry you always get the one with meat have you tried the ones that are vegetarian i always try everything because i like like variety you know i do not i like meat as well i can not lie i do like meat but i do like new options of food you know for example in my the food when you asked me about the food i was missing my favorite food for example in my home in my my house there in my home country it will be a lot at least 5 types of vegetables grains like rice and beans and maybe we can get some meat with the with the lunch you know but it is not we need to have meat it does not need to so i can eat everything you are not picky at all no i am not picky not really here in where i am now i people consume a lot of fish because it is basically all ocean around and so i try fish after like fucking 2 years something 2 years okay and and reaction what any reaction in your body or well i do not like makes you feels like the same or you thought too weird i did not it was delicious and yeah i did not find any difference and it was also with a very well condimented with oil and and lemon and stuff so it was it was nice but i i will not consume that much because my body already it is like used to not eating fish and i also am consuming this 0 omega 3 tablets you know that ones okay yeah yes so yeah so i will not consume that much so i do not need it i i at least like if i always listen to my body and if i do not need something i do not consume it you know i have been craving lo loads of vitamin for example like vitamins like c or d so i am getting a lot of fruits and i feel like my body is already reacting to this cause i it is something that i needed cause i i stopped eating meat when sorry fruits when i was in norway and in ireland and now i am coming back to the my old habits so yeah if you do not mind to say why you stopped to eat fruits is it because you you were like having problems to find nice fruits or just because you had another type of diet no it is because like i never liked that much the fruits in in ireland i never find it like so tasty i do not know if that happened to you like it is not so tasty and i do not like it yeah i try to get fruits at least once per week here shop then at least once per week but for example the strawberry i can say that now is the 1st time i am getting sweet strawberries here in ireland  like and i am buying strawberries every week for at least 8 months yeah so yeah 0 my god that is delicious that is the 1st time i am getting sweet strawberries really nice cause i think now it is the best season for them here yes due to the weather all the the stuff we have here and the problems with the land yeah but it is difficult to grow fruits here and have a a nice taste bananas for example for me they are they do not taste the same thing mango i try to get a mango like in the past and no no it is totally different no but you did not like it that is right you keep trying you know yeah you know that and there is a the blueberries are all over the place now yeah 0 that is amazing they are nice yeah but they are expensive as well and have you traveled that much around ireland in the last couple of months no not really i was talking yesterday with my friend that i am living here for 3 years and i am always having the problem that or i do not have the visa that makes me able to travel around or i do not have the time to go or i do not have the money you know so i am not getting too hard on myself as well due to this i am just trying to finish all my stuff like college for example  and then when finish i can plan and travel and the island and also other countries visit more europe you know cause i think it will be the best way for me cause i can get too distracted if i got another kind of stuff like trips on my way on my routine when in college or working for example you know and when you have the time to to travel where you want to go in europe i think the most basic destination will be london at 1st because i have not been there right and then i am thinking about go again to malta to visit my friend who is living there and i have another friend arriving there and also italy i want to be in italy does not matter if it be summer or autumn but i want to visit i think it is a nice country to to visit nice landscapes you know have you that will 3 next have you been there before destinations for me where have you been there before in italy no just my friends that they shared pictures with me but i know the place they are amazing but i have not had the opportunity to be there 0 okay so next have you been in italy yes i have been in few cities in italy and it is beautiful but i went in summer and it was scalding scalding like it was awful it was like 40 degrees i do not know and i could not stand it so it was kind of difficult the trip i am not really i cannot really stand the hot weather as you can see so i stay mainly in hotels you know with air conditioner on and also it is it is difficult to enjoy the cities when it is too hot because you cannot do that much work you know it is you get really tired fast so yeah i enjoy the city but not really that much the cities there i went to pompeii rome i forgot one city in the north and the other one venice venice was absolutely beautiful so i strongly recommend to go there it is beautiful you should go there definitely it is now the season in venice that it has we need to wear that wellington boats because we have like flood in the streets the street that left because most of the streets are canals canals right yeah you go by yeah but i think yeah but it is it is that is the most amazing thing that is everything canals and and you see the what is the name of this boat that travel through the canals gondolas gondolas yeah and you see the gondolas passing through and it is very unique and it probably is the only city in the world that is like this yeah like that unique yeah that is nice yeah yeah and what about other cities in in europe what what other cities call your attention france it is another country that caught get my attention and before i came here to europe i was looking for that city called nice i think it is in the south of france 0 nice yes like all the flowers and the colors from the mountains and we have there it is like amazing so for me they say they are used to say that it is a romantic destination but for me it is like just a nice place to be you know i really enjoy taking pictures from the nature and architecture so i think it would be an amazing city to be taking pictures visiting exploring the culture and also the food for example yeah would be nice yeah it is yeah do you have another yes i went there as well like stayed there for 2 days and it is yeah it is mediterranean style you know that that beautiful it is all beaches along the way yeah was very nice you you will definitely love it i know that is amazing do you have a new destination europ for you you like the beaches do you have a new destination for you are you planning here in asia for a long time now yes i am not quite sure when i want to be here until but my i am not planning and i never i am not planning in long term because i everyday changes for me so i am planning maximum 2 months yeah and the next month indonesia a city close to jakarta that is the capital of indonesia and yeah so it is beautiful cause it is an asian island and yeah it is quite nice i think i am going to enjoy it good okay that is cool that is so cool yeah and then i i do not know as i said it is future it is unknown for me for everyone but yeah i am not planning that much what about you what is your plan till the na the end of the year get my graduation done i am really now focused on my thesis so until september i will be doing this i think between october and november i will have the defense of this thesis and get my graduation and after that i can apply for a new job my new visa here and i think could be like i would be starting to settle down things here in ireland get a place for my own better job better salary you know so i think things will be working better in the end of this year cause for me it was when i started the course it was one year course and i was 0 my god the one year would take such a long time for me and it is one.5 year already yeah finish yeah time here like time flies fly on the space yeah fly it is too fast yeah it is like it is true i can say i just ended one week working or off from work and when i notice it is already friday again and i did just this stuff from college so i am literally a student now here this past year and since i arrived here and i have to like in september last year i am literally a student that (EDACC-C55-00)
hi my participant eh number is f c 58 dash p one hi my participant number is f c 58 dash p 2 okay so please call stella ask her to bring these things with her from the store 6 spoons of fresh snow peas 5 thick slabs of blue cheese and maybe a snack for her brother bob we also need a small plastic snake and a big toy a big toy frog for the kids she can scoop these things into 3 red bags and we will go meet her wednesday at the train station please call stella ask her to bring these things with her from the store 6 spoons of fresh snow peas 5 thick slabs of blue cheese and maybe a snack for her brother bob we also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids she can scoop these things into 3 red bags and we will go meet her wednesday at the train station okay so we can start our conversation if you want yes i am ready you want to tell me something for example how was your day well my day was great today i was doing some homework and and then i started eh you know searching for articles online about eh you know the you know the the weather and also you know how the markets are going okay simple daily things we yes check especially for the weather because here in italy it is boiling hot and yes i have been all day with my fan just beside me because i was literally melting yes i i totally get what you are saying i am always constantly drinking cold water because otherwise i will literally melt just like you said and also i just finished to fill my bottle with ice yes well let us say that especially here on the countryside there is not even a lot of wind so you know there is not even the the cold the cold that can be on on the countryside we we do not experience it here so no no but you know it started since i live near the seaside let us say sometimes i can go there to breathe some fresh water from the sea but do not think that here in the city there is more wind than in the countryside because sometimes the heat of i you know cars and all the ty types of you know pollution makes the air even hotter than in the countryside sometimes also the hotness here in the countryside is even worse because there is no actual times of the day where it is not hot so the weather is constantly i get it reminding me that i can not go to the sea and  i have not even sunbathed this year me neither i went to let us just say a touristic location touristic location because there there were also a lot of people near where we live and i burned my skin and my my arm is totally totally red since i am super white and i cannot sunbathe either even if i try because it actually was a cool day but you know and this is my situation and my condition skin condition let us say well have you tried i do not know putting aloe vera on top of the scar i am allergic you know 0 yeah that is true  i am sorry i always forget that you are allergic to aloe vera yeah which which is a downside because aloe vera is good for everything i know actually i do not know when it was like this week let us say i was looking at some methods to make my hair let us say healthier and less dry than they are in this moment and aloe vera was one of the 1st ingredients and elements that could help my hair but 2 weeks ago just to confirm my my being allergic to aloe vera i put on it was like a shower cream shower something and it burned all of my legs like i actually started to see bubbles it was when i was in northern italy i was traveling in northern italy and i actually did not know what i was putting on my legs actually after this allergic moment i saw that aloe vera was in the ingredients and then i understood why but i am here you should always check the labels especially if you are allergic to something yes but it was you know the little thing that give you they they give you in hotels in bb yeah okay you know i was not expecting them to be composed by aloe vera i thought they were accessible for everyone because a lot of people are allergic to it i think i am you are the only you are the only person i know that actually is allergic to aloe vera so i would not say that a lot of people are but i feel like you would say a lot of people are because you are we allergic to aloe vera yeah but yes i understand i can tell you that actually aloe vera is very healthy for hair but if you can not use it there is also flaxseed eh gel which is very good for skin and i saw it too hair yes but it is a bit more complicated to make the diy okay like i have a lot of flaxseed because there was this period where i wanted to put it everywhere but eh i saw that it was a bit complicated to make and why and even what well i think the problem with you know gel diy is is the fact that you can not actually store it so you have to make very little amounts and then you have to you know store it in a fridge for 3 or 4 days otherwise they go bad and i hate it because i am not very consistent with diy methods and all of that  like i i would prefer to freeze it but i think that also freezing products is not once preserved there are there are elements there are nourishments that you yeah can not find in there so which is a bummer by the way because aloe vera is great for m i have experienced that aloe vera is very good for my hair and skin and the other day i was washing my face after i have i have done a facial mask with aloe vera and the next day was just beautiful yeah i saw it and i was like 0 that is that is that my skin 0 really yeah i also saw a girl i forgot just this girl that uses hair gua sha with a a bit of aloe vera on her face and her face is glowing and i am jealous because i cannot use it and you know i also have other products to use with the face massages but i feel like aloe vera is perfect because it is jelly it is it is not oily so you will not wash your face roughly after it but you know i am allergic i have accepted it i can not even try i can not you are just accepting it because i feel sorry for you honestly because for your hair which is very dry and and sometimes it get it gets a bit brittle oiling your hair with rosemary oil which you do  is not like for me it is not the right option like for me specifically like every 3 days but i do oil my hair i find out that actually rosemary oil is very good for hair thanks to you yes it was good for everything also because if you use olive oil produced here in italy extra virgin olive oil it nourishes your hair deeply yes so for for you it might be a great option to you know increase the times of the week you actually oil your hair like i would do it if i were you especially in this period because your hair might get very very dry and dryer than in the winter yeah yes you would not even imagine how my skin because i suffer of a skin condition in my my the back of my head okay the also in the upper part of my head my skin gets dry it is a medical condition  so what i did is i went to the seaside and it was a sandy beach of course what happened is that little parts of sand got into my hair because you know i started running with my dog we were playing so sand was everywhere and it started to make my head itch it was terrible and then i used olive oil just to cover all of the mistake i have i had made i have been madeing before and some part of it was okay but i think i have to to to to do better i have to increase the times when i do it in the week because it is with the fact that it is really hot i think this condition is getting worse and worse day by day i can feel it and my hair is like really damaged yeah i feel like i have to go to a doctor totally yes again i think you should because well i think the summer makes everything works worse so you know if you go to the doctor it is i think even if he tells you things that you already know at least you are sure that you are okay yeah and that you have to use certain products instead of the ones that you are using now because they are not working in the way that they should but do not worry i think it is just a matter of the weather being too hot because when you started using rosemary oil oil your hair had dramatically increased improved in you know the the shine yeah and they were more much more manageable they also got have got have gotten a little darker which i like on you now they are even blonder they on the contrary because of sun and i am always at home so i i do not understand how the sun is bleaching my hair but yeah at least it is sun and not real bleach because otherwise your hair would be no but it would just fall off entirely no no no no no no absolutely not i think i could i could not bleach my hair i think that damages are nothing that you want you know too many they they her they cannot you know i think that the damages goes directly on the roots you can not shave it after well the you know what they say in every video they say that if you do not have an healthy scalp your hair will ne will never grow in the way they should no so and i do not think it just starts from the scalp i think it is also a matter of diet and and stress levels 0 yeah but if you are stressed your hair is very i is less likely to grow and to be healthy so one thing is the stress but also i think als external conditions are also very very bad yes and that may you know hur hurt hurt your your hair and damage it yeah i have i remember that when during university my hair were were like a nest of birds and they were dry and damaged and also because i used to eat like junk food to feel happier or just to do not feel depressed depressed and nowadays my my skin is better but my hair hair have worse worsened because of summer so i am in a loop but you know i thanks to the fact that university is over i am not that depressed anymore and i am not eating junk food i am getting skinnier which is something i like yes well you were not that fat before so i do not think like no no no i am not fat i i was not fat but you know i choppy in my legs i have a little bit of fat in my stomach there is a i j i just have a stomach i am not i am not flat at all so well girl i think the the the thing is that i think a flat stomach is i think is something genetical like genetics yeah but it is little parts of it but it is also the diet that makes a lot of the difference in in the way you see your stomach you know my body type is like how do you say it like a triangle like i have wider hips is it i do not think i do not know i think it is rec rectangle rectangle but you know my waist is not that little like i do not know i like my body type either way okay but i have wider hips than than shoulders so likely inverted triangle inverted triangle yeah 0 yeah okay but it is something very slight so it is not that big of a difference in like if you see me from the front i am not really inverse inverted triangle because my my hips are not that wide no no no no of course but they are wider than normal than normal people will  well i mean than other people okay so yeah but i have also noticed that in summer everyone gets skinnier yeah like i do not know if it is because we drink more so our body get more cleansed and it just expels bad things and i do not know we get skinnier because we sweat way more than we do in the in the in winter and also i think it is also because i started walking and i do walk a lot since i work you know in that pub and you know i walk a lot and it is a lot of dis a distance for like 12 hours a night i think that is probably i and i barely eat there basically because every time we start to eat me and my coworkers we also we everyone has something to do so we also we we all eat like separately and also we do not eat at at 8 or at 9 we just eat something whenever we can  so i eat very way less than i did before and also very sporadically like what you you work at night am i right i work from 5 p m to 5 a m basically depending on the depending on when we when we close the the pub okay yes but honestly there is there are like dead those dead hours where no one comes or it is just a few tables of course so you know 11 of my other coworkers can just relax for a bit and then we just each give get our moment to relax and when it is too dead we just basically close the pub because there is nothing else to do okay now i i see your point when i used to work at the restaurant there were some hours or even nights when nobody showed up and i was completely free to be on my own and to prepare things for the next day for example but we could not close because the restaurant was inside of a hotel so we had to be at our client is disposal you know right i understand so well our pub is not like inside of a hotel so we can kind of decide when to stop and when to close the shop but it is also you know be with it being a pub there is also the thing that more most of the of the patrons come in at you know ungodly hours and you are to you cannot close the shop because that is the that is revenue that is still revenue of course and since the pub is relatively new it is not like they can close whenever they want so we have to get there and wait for people to go away is it in the city center let us say city center i think it is very close to the city center so yeah and a lot of people go there am i right not a lot but you know what sometimes a lot of people come in and then they get out like after 5 or 10 minutes because they just drink and go yeah do a lot of shots yes yes just drink and go or some of them just stay for hours and hours on end and they just order one or 2 things and just stay there on the table occupying the table basically for hours and they are just rude and there are times where like they come they stay for a few for i do not know half an hour and they just go away and they just spend all that money and they give you tips like i am not not a lot of tips have you received tips because we yes we do like i do not know maybe the the patrons that come often very often or like almost every day they just they do leave tips because they know or even friends of the of the owners okay they come in and they just i do not know they get a bottle of water it is it costs i do not know one or €2 and the rest of the they they give the owner €5 and the rest of the tip it is is ju it just goes in the tips and you share it right the the change and you share it every day or at the end of the week for example the end of the no we buy a little container that is i think a metal we just put the tips there and when it gets completely full we just cut it because you cannot open it okay otherwise okay cut that up and then i think we will share it between the like a piggy bank the coworkers yes like a piggy bank exactly like that okay that is cute when i when i worked at the hotel  i i was not paid because it was a  and i was in front and the funny thing is that we were supposed to share tips but since i was not paid a coworker of mine told me you know you know dude tell me tell me where the piggy bank is and so i told her and she decided that i i could take the the money for me like she brought me there thinking that i was putting the money in the piggy bank and then she put it in my in my little bag  that is since i was not being paid that makes sense because i mean you are still offering a service you are providing the service for other clients you are not paid so at least the least they could do is you know now you know because give you the tips let us let us put some context in it because my patron was really attached to money and even if the storage was meant to be paid you know sometimes they give you something they give you also €10 to go and get a beer or a glass of wine or to eat something with your friends since i was with my friends there we were working altogether and some of them were they were getting at least their own tips  they could get them to go anywhere just as a reward of what they had done but this man even it was if if if if it was like a 5 star hotel and a lot of rich people went there or sometimes italian people i saw there very rich people he was so attached to money that he could not care less of me not having money you know he could not care less he thought that it was my responsibility to go outside and eat and drink to go with my friends after my shift could not care less so i was i had the opportunity to get some of the money thanks to my colleague because she knew this situation well that is horrible honestly huh because as i said you are that is horrible because you are yeah you are just working for them you are making them make money and they do not even pay you and they will not even let you have the tip that is all ea all earned sorry it is all earned it is all your work there yeah and at least like let me get my money and they do not which is horrible now there it wor it works differently like even when i went to other to other restaurants to eat the other day i was substituting a friend of mine in in her work and she works at a restaurant and they pay me like €35 a night  and there were these these brazilian customers and they paid a lot and i think in bra in brazil and in america in general tips are paid like they are mandatory yeah so they gave yes so they gave us like €20 and the the the owner was like you can get €10 it is all your work so it was like 20 is for the other coworker and no 10 is for the other coworker and the other half is yours so i was like okay i made i just made €45 today and i was super happy of course because it is like a reward and it feels great also  and yes they are mandatory at least in in usa sorry because my uncle told me that they are written in the bill  so when you are paying you are paying also tips which is strange to us because we do not pay tips yes that is right like which is it is very it is stupid to you know not to not tip the waiter because yes i mean you are paying for the for the ingredients and for everything else but you are not paying for their actual job like you are paying part of it but you should also pay for their service u unless it is not good which is which happens very yes a lot of times also like you remember when we went to the restaurant and actually i wanted to tip i think we tipped them right we tipped them when we were there yes yeah we did we did and i loved the the atmosphere in that restaurant it was very good and also the food they were very good people yes they were so nice i want to go there as well right now yes 0 and that is far away  we have to take an airplane to go there so i do not think it is possible at the moment yes at the at the moment it is not possible but yes i think i will visit the city later me too maybe not this year but me too because for example if we are going to to live in northern italy  it is way more simple to to reach every big city there instead of living in the south of course there are trains working a lot and some schedules of trains are you know weird here here yes but there there are if you have to for example go to rome from  milan you take 43 hours it is fair but in the southern regions in 3 or 4 hours you cannot reach anything  yes i mean you can reach a small city but like i mean way it is way quicker if you take yeah yeah if you take your car and you go by car yeah yeah it is hor it is also horrible the streets are horrible here but yes i think yeah i mean i want to go in the norther city i wanted to i i actually wanted to go outside of italy but i do not know where and yeah and now i was searching today and i was like it is horrible to live here because if i want to go anywhere else like the the the costs are high like high high yeah like you can not take anything you can not take the train because it will be a very long journey and i have no time to i do not know spend 2 days on a train just to go there and not counting you know going back to the place i live so it is horrible actually so i i just really want to go away from here you are thinking about northern italy or well the plan other countries the original plan was to other to go to other countries like i do not know france or belgium like i do not but after today i think france is like completely cut and cut off did you talk with did you talk with other colleagues colleagues yes you were there we were in search for the university online with them yeah online with them yes they had a conversation i was not there because i was working for my thesis sorry but i really wanted to be there yeah no do not worry and i i saw bad things you know it was confusing yes i saw bad things you saw bad things you do not know half of it like for real like we were searching for for all universities there and there was none that was open like you have to you know apply for the university and all the applications ended in that like the deadline was on may the 15th or 13th yes that is what that is what i saw all the other all the other and also you had to go to another platform to get to apply for a certain university and depending on university the platform was the same the university was not i saw yeah and you had to make a new account every time for every different university and it was horrible because i was the one doing all this and the others were just you know looking with me sharing the screen and i was going insane because you know they asked asked for your for your degree if you had any other degree if you had your graduation and all that it was horrible and all of that for 2 hours straight just to see that all the applications ended on at at may in may 15 when we still had accents from our university and we was horrible because you there were a lot of pre requirements and huh and all of that and now and i am still way more exhausted than i thought i would be and way more demotivated i am i do not have any motivation to do anything right now yes and the only university that are still open are in mal at malta and in belgium 2 universities 3 actually 3 but i still do not and in their sites there is still no indication on which forms and andor documents you have to to give them to apply so there is written like application application deadlines ends on the 31st of august but there is still no indication of what you have to actually present to to to give them as documents they absolutely have you tried what have you thought of calling them like like calling them reaching them writing an email for example i can see that that line why there is not indication about what i have to give you what do you want just write to them i think they are way more efficient than here they will answer our questions yes i well i will certainly i think me and the and our colleagues will meet tomorrow i guess i do not know online again i am taking a wild guess yes online again and we will see what what to do what to what to see more but i think all of us are really you know under the weather after seeing that all of the things that we wanted to do yeah are not open like i feel like i have lost a race even even before participating like i i have i have not even participated in a race and i am and i have still lost  and it is horrible yeah everything related to what we would like to do is horrible i think there are no opportunities and if they are i if there are there are very strict you know schedules and very strict you know requirements that you must have i get it and they are just impossible and only few people can just have the opportunity to train well and to study that wow i i do not know actually i do not know how much time before your academic here ends you have to think about all of that i just have no time to do it to do to to think about all of those things before it ends actually so when it ends yes because we have to so much work to do still yes when it ends we just have to go with the flow and wait for for anything to be clear i do not know how you think it is they i think everything will clear up i hope so we hope (EDACC-C53-00)

create a character and you know you can also build like a house for yourself  and basically like in what is it like minecraft more like the sims 0 the the the sims yeah yeah i i i used to buy like yeah okay yeah i i also like 1st person shooter yeah but but i think i i i preferred role play games rather than shoo shoo shooting games yeah i i used to play simulation games si simulator game but yeah i i i i think i prefer role playing okay so is there one you remember well of is there like the the most favorite game you play so the sims they have like so they they i i think they create like 4 games but my my favorite one is probably the the 3rd the the the the 3rd sims game because the because i i really enjoy building houses in the sim stream because their 0 yeah that is true yeah their their their system is very is very good okay yeah i i remember that game i used to to really like to design new houses in in sim and some time you you show me one of your designs yeah so that they were were good okay so what about books or film or tv show honestly i i did not i did not read a lot of books when i was little but there is this there is this one book so there is this one comic called cedric is about 0 yeah is about like a little boy and like he he lives in french okay he is french he lives with with his parents and and his grandpa and he does some he he does a lot of s silly things that were very funny to me as as a as a kid 0 yeah i i i also remember that that book but it is in in french and my french was not really good at at the time so i i did not read a lot of books cedric but yeah i i i i read some english version somewhere and yeah i i i i remember that story and i think there are there are some similar books like like that like nicolas they are yeah books of french writers yeah but i i i prefer marvel comics yeah i i read a lot i read a lot of marvel comics probably like several like several 1000 issues of wow of marvel yeah and yeah which which which series i is your is your favorite i i think my 1st my 1st ever one of my 1st ever and most like most memorable series was the new avengers but actually marvel comics they had like a really long history and some there are some issues they refer to the event that was very far in the past and to to to understand the whole story and also references in in in the comics you need to like read a lot of related book and sometime sometime weak events happen happens and you need to read all time times yeah and so to to understand the times you you need to read other other title of other characters yeah so actually marvel has has like 3000 heroes it is it is a lot of to to read and you actually need to remember a lot of things and i i spend i i think i spend a lot of time to to read all of the comics and i have read several times so yeah yeah so w which like which character was was your like is your favorite of all like 3000 characters okay yeah back then there there used to there used to be a game called marvel heroes 2016 or something and you can actually play the characters and while most of most of the characters that i that i had in the game i i think they are my favorite so when whenever i get a new character i read all the comics so my 1st character was black panther okay and and he is he has like a really cool cool superpower he has like a a really advanced suit like from vibranium and he has like he he was like a trained martial artist and he is very rich also apart from that there were iron man and well probably thor actually i i do not like thor that that that much because like he is he is too powerful yeah and i i think what my most favorite you know is is spiderman yeah because he yeah yeah he he he he overcomes so much harsh and he is he is still a a hero even though he he is so poor okay yeah he he is very poor he is in yeah yeah but i i think lately the quality of comic books it is it is going like going down so yeah yeah it is not as good as before i i think the period from from 2000 to about 2011 or 2012 they are the best best period of of comic books okay yeah okay so apart from that do you do you watch do you watch movie movie or tv show yeah i i actually i do not watch a lot but i like but when i do i mostly watch like tv like movies and and series from from marvels as well from the marvel cinematic universe i i think they have a couple of new series released recently i think it is called miss marvel okay but did did you watch them all or you already heard about them no i i did not i have not started watching miss marvel yet but they also had like a different series called moon knight released yeah it was released recently i think it is i think it is very good the way they the way they explore this this character because usually when there is a there is a new character coming out like they would dig very deep into like their past and the way they they they get their powers but in moon knight they just kind of jump straight into the like the action and stuff huh i think it is just very interesting 0 yeah yeah because i think like some sometimes origin story of heroes are quite boring and yeah be because a as i as i said before because marvel has already has such a long history of of characters and may maybe some character was invented like 70 or 60 years ago so yeah if if they they get to the original story then it would be very boring and i i think they want the craft like a dy dynamic you know is actually between the characters that is why they jump straight into the the the current story yeah and and yeah maybe they can explain the the the start of those hero later like in the flash flashback or or or something yeah yeah yeah so so they yeah probably they they they do not want do that yeah but yeah but i think that marvel marvel show is for for some reason they are they are not really really good because they they want to build up so many so many thing at at once they want to introduce yeah new new characters and new event and they want everything to to to tie in to together in into one big universe so yeah even even the whole show it is just like 11 small part of of the of the big of one bigger show yeah so so that is why they they feel very disconnected yeah in order to make them connect together each one feel very disconnected from from from the whole things so i i i am sure if if they can keep up like this because actually after after a long period of reading the marvel comics i actually want to read like coming from other brand like indepe independent independent author or like or comic from a smaller publisher yeah because they are more more creative and they they do not rely too much on established characters some sometime i i do some comics of of marvel that that that do like a like a different formula appearance yeah is like yeah they explore explore the alternate version of of hero so so they are much much more interesting yeah be because you know how they sometimes they just kill a character and like bring them back like 2 yeah yeah to the show la later yeah so they yeah like like the main they kind of sorry they they lose lose all minutes yeah so yeah maybe this is not not it it will happen to the xu in in the future yeah so so i i i feel like a lot of the new like the new series and like also the the new issues of of the comics like they became like they started becoming very commercial like this i see yeah it feel it feels like they a a lot of those movies like they they make it just to just to please like the fans right but they do not really focus on like the the depth of the the characters or yeah like no no development yeah yeah and like each each movie like there is there is one new dirt and each each story they are like new new writer yeah so so so it is it is not per persistent yeah and yeah most most of the most most of time they just make the to sell more more more toys yeah more toys as far as most of the kids so even even the the show like like like the an animated version is is not very good there was some some really good good show but like for some reason they just can cancel them i dunno so so so i am not sure about marvel anymore like there used to be really good yeah but yeah i i think it is because they they probably do not make enough of money from from those like from those that they they cancel or is because some there is some other reasons right yeah so so i think this yeah yeah okay so what sport do you play i mean in the sport when you was a kid i i really like i really liked badminton actually took a badminton class when i was i think 4th grade or 5th grade yeah but but i do not see you pay it anymore i i know i i kind of i kind of got like lazier and i also like i could not find a lot of time for for sports re recently i actually so so so at so at school there is there is this like i have to do gym gym class gym classes and i i took like swimming classes like i know how to i i know how to swim already but you know i still took like swimming classes just to you know get the opportunity to yeah to swim yeah to swim and to you know like to probably you know like work out a movement 0 yeah totally yeah and probably in increase your your height a bit more yeah okay  yeah so so you only honestly recently no other other kind of sport yeah yeah usually only swimming i i i do not know if rope skipping count as a as a sport or is it just like a one of the workouts yeah just like ca cardio workout yeah yeah i i i used to play like basketball too when i when i was like in the 6th grade yeah but yeah  a after a while after a while i i also forgot how to play and i do not know how to play that much anymore because when i when i get to high school my my friend most of them do not do not play do not play that that game that stopped so yeah i i kind of kind of stopped there and yeah li literally i i only do like some workout at at the gym and or maybe at home so yeah i i do not yeah really play like that anymore but like if if you have a chance you you play like stuff when you play more sport or like if you find if you find a team or something because i i want to play like the table tennis yeah but but it is really hard to to 0 okay yeah yeah to get my friend to to play this after work they most of them like very tired and actually i have i have some you know table tennis ra racket here with me but like i i cannot find anyone to to play because of the work hours here so so yeah yeah i i i i think most of most of my friends like they they play soccer a lot so they have like they they have soccer teams and i i probably would i mean i i i do not like i do not like soccer that much yeah i think like personally i i think it is it is it is quite boring but  i probably would you know try to engage in in more activities maybe go play soccer sometimes with with the with the friends so too like you know like connect with them or like like you know have have like a yeah social life right yeah but not like for for the sport per se yeah just do it for you know to to to be active to be more active and so yeah yeah so so my sport is not not like a strong so so you know if you do not play then do you wa watch sport like a lot i i do like i i do follow the like the events but i do not really like spend time to to for example watch a full game or something 0 yeah that is true yeah yeah me me too because like when when if i see something on on tv like like some football match or like some match probably i i will watch it but i do not like actively like sit sit yeah yeah i will program to watch to watch them yeah so yeah i kind of really like the old kind of life i have been particularly fond of it yeah yeah yeah of course okay so what about your next holiday where where would you go where would you where are you planning to go my next holiday i i plan to go to ho chi minh city in july or august but i i also really want to to to visit foreign countries such as you know for example singapore or australia or thailand  i i have never i have never been in in foreign countries before so 0 all right that is true yeah like never been outside vietnam yeah it is okay yeah i probably think you should go i i have been to singapore and australia and and china and laos yeah but i i think yeah i i think like the best destination for for you now is singapore because it is it is it is a lot it is a lot diff different from from vietnam and you know i i also plan to go singapore you know my friend one of my best friends is working in malaysia right now and i have planned to visit visit him i was also also go to singapore maybe also in in august and i i live in in australia for like 2 years so i i i could show you some some places that you can go visit yeah so yes yeah good so will you work will you like to work in australia later or just to visit i i actually i i i do not know at at the moment but i mean if the i mean if if the opportunity comes then yeah like why not yeah yeah you you should go you should go and and have a job because like australia is one of the best place one of best places to to live yeah 0 i i think it is okay so yeah sorry yeah so when when when you when you were in australia like what what was the what was the most like different aspects to to life compared to like when you were in vietnam like what what change okay so so the people in australia they have like a very relaxed lifestyle they just go go to work like 7 or 7 and half hour a day and and on the weekend they just like go have like a trip either like go to a park or take a hike or like some some people even even if they do not have like a lot of money they they have like a boat or something if they are poor they have like small boat and if they are like rich they have like big one and they just like go like to in the mid middle of the ocean like do some f fishing yeah well i i i i had a chance to go go go fishing with with some of my friends when when i was there and yeah like we re relaxing and one of one of the things that they the like the seas or the ocean and they are clean so yeah 0 yeah i know when when you go fishing you can just like eat eat the fish directly yeah just cook it and eat it wow yeah so so nice the life is very interesting and now what else and also if you you live in in some city like like adelaide or perth and they are not very not not like not yeah not like in in in in our our city now so yeah because i am you know i am i am an introverted person so i i do not really like to have too too many people around me and yeah i i think that is what is the like the perfect environment for for me i am not sure about you but like yeah what else they i i think in australia there the tax is very hard you you you can be taxed like 30 to 40% depending on your income yeah but well yeah with with with the tax with the taxes that that high then the i i think the the the how how to call that the the like the the the yeah 0 yeah yeah the welfare the welfare is is very good the wel the welfare yeah you you are provided everything like you know when you go to hospital is like practical like practically free and they build a lot of parks for for for kids and for for people in each neighborhood there there must be one like one park yeah so you can so everyone can have easy access to to the park and in in some of the big one big ones they have like like the the barbecue station yeah so wow so so you can just bring your bring your food there and you can have a barbecue with with your friends like barbecue is is a very big things in in australia like if if if the temperature is like 30 or 35 they hey still they still invite you to barbecue they do not really care about the heat so so this was very strange at the 1st but yeah i get used to it yeah so if if i had if i had a chance i i would i would also go go back to the to australia yeah i i i think it is also very like like very safe there like there is a lot of you know security and safe safe a lot of safety i am i am not sure because when i go to the to the city center there there is like many people who is loit who is loitering and i do not think that they work and they also like ask you for for money for for change for like some some coin so yeah and i think some some women there are harassed you know and yeah so in city city center it is not quite quite safe but like in in like the suburb there is like there is not many there is not many people so so so maybe you you feel you feel less safe but like nothing ever happens there yeah so so probably it is much safer in like the suburb but like there is there is not many people no however there is there is one thing that maybe maybe still scares me because because they they have like so they they are very like spacious you know they they have so many like land like empty land so maybe when when when they when some people are killed then the body will be buried buried somewhere that that is really hard to find yeah so so yeah so that is 11 of the things that still bo bothers me about australia yeah i am i am not sure how how you feel about that and before before i went to australia i had a fear about like like very big big spider and big animals in australia but when i go there when i lived in the city actually i like almost never never see any like really big big ones like just like regular regular size regular size spiders yeah so so maybe if you live if you live in outback of australia then you would need to worry about that yeah i i i think a lot of a lot of people and you know also the media like they they tend to exaggerate do you like the situation a lot 0 yeah so yeah i i think like tho those animals they only like they only live in like certain areas but people would just you know exaggerate it and you know scare scare foreigners 0 yeah that is that is true actually not the case okay yeah but yeah actually they have like lot of kan kangaroos and at at the time i am i am sure what was it what is mar marsupial right like like the yeah like with with the bats yeah yeah yeah so yeah they they they have they do have some like real cute cute ones yeah but but but big one and scary one they they also have that yeah so probably you should prepare for that before you go to australia otherwise the yeah australia is is a really good place to to live and maybe you should like move there and become like a a permanent resident or like a citizen or something yeah it is yeah i highly recommend australia fully or what about yeah eu europe do you want to go been there because i have never been there too you know and i i i would i would like to g to europe somewhere but i am i am not sure about living in europe right but what about you yeah i i i want to to like visit a few countries but i do not think i am going to live there i i i i have heard a lot of you know not very nice things about like the life over there but i am also not sure because like those opinions might just be you know subjective and need to do some research on that but by the way we we only have less than a minute on the meeting okay yeah zoom zoom is going to close all right so let us finish the conversation later and say if we hit if not enough and then i think we will continue another one session all right bye bye (EDACC-C58-00)

blue cheese and maybe a snack for her brother bob we also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids she can scoop these things into 3 red bags and we will go meet her wednesday at the train station please call stella ask her to bring these things with her from the store 6 spoons of fresh snow peas 5 thick slabs of blue cheese and maybe a snack for her brother bob we also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids she can scoop these things into 3 red bags and we will go meet her wednesday at the train station so i think we were had decided to talk about some television memories from when we were kids and what it was like kind of growing up in ireland in the late 70s and eighites yeah and then the major discovery of uk and american television when we were both about 10 years of age so i was just remarking kind of how bleak it was back in say the late 70s and early 80s for kids and children is programming even educational stuff there was not much of it on irish television do you think no not much and it was very rare even that you would get imports like sesame street the closest thing they had was i do not know if you remember bosco yeah i do yeah everything was centered around puppets sure for early irish television because it was obviously cheaper but yeah i think bosco was the main educational thing was not exactly sesame street standard but i think they were really limited in their budget on on their production 0 and imagination by the looks of it as well yeah but yeah i remember bosco it was fine if you were like a preschooler or in you know babies in in primary school but once you hit maybe 5 or 6 you kind of grew out of it and there was nothing really that stopped the gap until we were much later much older yeah i mean it shows there was a lot of i think a serious lack of imagination when it came kids were kind of an afterthought when it came to television and radio and entertainment back in those early days and i guess the biggest change for the 2 of us would have been when we were kind of exposed to english television and by default american television yeah and in my house that i was about 10 i think when that happened so that would have been about mid 80s about 1985 yeah and we had to get an aerial put on a roof it was a whole day out and there was a man who had to come and put it up and i had to run in and out of the sitting room and shout up at him when the picture was good put that 1st weekend i got up really early and watched my 1st weekend of english children is tv and it was a revelation yeah i remember when we got it 1st it was just so colorful it was not as yeah drab or dreary as irish tv with their you know limited budgets and cheap sets i remember saturday swap shop with noel yeah edmonds and that just that was yeah eye opening but it was always so depressing when you were a kid in ireland that you could not join in you could not enter competitions you sometimes you could not even find some of the stuff they used for the artsy craft the materials that were impossible yeah you could not i never knew what a pipe cleaner was we never saw pipe cleaners no i think that was my early exposure there was a show called number 73 mmh and it was just i would say like you said the biggest memory initially was color and excitement and it seemed to be like almost an adult format but it was designed for kids yeah and there was so much stuff happening and wacky stuff and funny stuff and it used to switch from cartoons to comedy to drama and then the mandatory make and do stuff but the same thing all these materials it all just seemed really exotic and england seemed like a long long way away  but i was really jealous i thought to myself i will never get to go cause they used to have kids on the set in the audience and they used to win like fantastic prizes and go on holidays and stuff like that too and like you say i was always really envious looking across the water so to speak at england and it just seemed really exciting and exotic and kind of far from where we were at totally and what was even more exciting was where we grew up we got the northern ireland feed for the uk 0 yeah yeah which was was separate as well which was separate yeah they had like yeah utv and itv but mainly yeah it was like a lot of their productions were from northern ireland why do not you and those kind of things yeah but if if you went to visit family up in dublin they actually received the bbc whales or the itv from london 0 wow and that that got you some serious cartoons yeah yeah that you would not see on irish tv a good caliber no yeah quality of cartoons you know and we market on irish cartoons because after we got the english channels you would kind of rarely go back to irish tv if you were a kid but i do not know if you remember back in the late 70s and 80s they used to buy in these cartoons from i think it was places like czechoslovakia and poland could have even been from the former soviet republic but the strange thing about them was that there were political kind of cartoons which is no speaking and strange animation and really disturbing music mmh and they used to put those on for kids and the contrast when you saw some of the stuff that was coming in from america as well through the english channels that was just such an eye opener it was huge in the mid 80s yeah and that was the thing you would talk to your friends about it on a monday morning you would go to school and you would talk about all the cartoons that you saw i guess then tv shows you are starting to get exposed to especially american ones do you have any immediate favorites well i remember one of the 1st times seeing the flintstones sure right when when we were growing up the flintstones were around for a long time but i did not understand that i did not know that there was such thing as a rerun i did not know what it meant yeah yeah yeah so when i saw things on tv i assumed that you know they were made especially for me nevermind that there were just the 1st viewing of them yeah and i remember my dad came into the room when i was watching the flintstones and he went 0 i used to love this when i was a kid that blew my mind as like yeah you you saw this when you were a yeah child and he he used to laugh his head off at the saute tiger kicking fred flinstone out the window at the very end yeah that that used to crack me up but just to get anything from the states was was huge especially when rtp yeah off their budget and they managed to import things so yeah yeah but i but i think they had to there was so many people opting for cause the original old old sky television was just on the horizon mmh and you could also avail of kind of like you said english channels and welsh channels in northern ireland so irish broadcasting kind of had to up its game a little but it still did not do too much for kids or children is programming but i think one of my all time favorites and one that crosses generations is obviously sesame street because 0 yeah that was just huge when you were a kid that had everything that had fun learning puppets comedy humor drama brilliant animation and yeah that was a huge influence when i was a kid yeah you know well especially when you saw it and you saw where they lived in sesame street and the thing you wanted the most as a kid was to live there or to knock yeah to knock on big birds door and you know yeah to say yeah i i see mister schuffman because too you are not the only yeah one these little things they used to really yeah involve your imagination when you were a kid it was amazing and the catchy songs and even not just the puppets and muppets that really but the humans were endearing like mister hooper and yeah the beautiful red shiny apples he used to sell in his store yeah you just wanted to go in there and buy something it was just a it was like a fantasy but it was somewhere that was achievable it was attainable in our minds you know yeah and also was just there was so much humor in it too mmh and it kind of related to another one of my favorites that would have crossed over from the parents generation too which was the muppet show yeah and it was kind of had i used to kind of confuse the 2 i used to always so did i muppet show yeah the muppet show was an evening version of sesame street you know it was the grown up sunday evening yeah but the the main difficulty was you grew up an only child whereas i had siblings i had 2 brothers and buck rogers in the 25th century was scheduled on at the same time as the muppet show so there was blue murder every sunday evening over who got to watch which yeah i was blessed because there would be large parts of the day that i would have the television just to myself so i did not have to compete so what was that that must have been tough when you have got 2 siblings and you are both of slightly different ages  and obviously there is no recording facilities then and  that was the thing i think kids probably do not appreciate these days that you you had to be there you had to see it once yeah and if you missed it you missed it and that was the thing with tv back then that you would not know when something might be shown again  it it is not like if you could look it up it might be shown once and it could be 3 years later before it is it is shown again so yeah well i remember growing up in the uk you would often see on the british channels you know mention of the radio times yeah and we did have we did have some kind of an equivalent called the rte guide yeah but nobody nobody bought us only at christmas to get the bumper maybe 3 weeks it was firm that is what it was yeah spread of what was on yeah so you get it for the whole month but nobody used to buy it so nobody would even i do not know if they even showed the tv schedule in the papers back then it was very rare well i was actually thinking of that there was so cause there would have been approximately maybe at most 10 or 11 channels so at one point in time the paper near the back page used to have a whole page just devoted in 6 or 7 columns and you could read down what was on so that was a daily thing and the paper always seemed cheaper than the actual tv guide itself  you know so when you are reading the paper for other things as well so i think they shared around the family and then there was so yeah there was so many channels then it was simply not cost effective to kind of to print it  you know what i mean and regarding like american stuff especially like  drama shows where you got out of the kind of cartoon age and then you would have all these shows like say macgyver and the a team and sci fi stuff as a girl wonder woman wonder woman as a girl would have been a big one for you  so what was wonder woman wonder woman was the ultimate female superhero and she was a princess diana prince during the day and she was some mysterious amazonian princess who came to earth yeah i think she was her i am not sure yeah she was from another planet but she arrived to help earthlings and i believe it was during world war ii which was another passion of mine so that kind of helped me hope as well it was strange growing up with 2 older brothers and playing toy soldiers what you did and that is what you did yeah so it kind it kind of rubbed off on me in what i used to yeah watch but my brother said no objection watching wonder woman either trust me there was never any rules yeah over watching wonder woman they were watching it for different reasons but she was an idol she was strong and you know forthright yeah and she solved problems and she spun around and turned into wonder woman and she had a bike and an invisible plane that that was just amazing there was not it is not like now i guess with all the marvel stuff and you know i guess back then she must have been a big figure because cast of my mind back cause i used to like a lot of the comic book kind of stuff  and i would watch batman and spiderman and the incredible hulk so i guess wonder woman was one of the few kind of female kind of empowered role model type characters so that must have been important to be in a girl especially in a boy is house kinda watching we had very few women that we could look up to mainly soap yeah opera stars that is a whole other yeah conversation yeah but really like you know in batman you had batgirl but that was towards the end and it was more of a gimmick yeah it was very very rare that there was a woman on tv that had that kind of status and made that kind of impression on kids yeah and she was there so much so i had a wonder woman is swimming suit and i thought  i thought i was wonder woman i was convinced of it that was the power that that show yeah had over me at that such an influential influential age yeah i guess when i look back and think on tv from when i was 101112 it was very boy and kind of male centered  a lot of action shows stuff like airwolf and okay blue thunder and it was always like a man on a machine and but did you like those kind of programs too where you kind of have a tomboy attitude to watching some of those or it was a case of because you had such limited choice if it was sure yeah if it was watchable and it was not you know a a politics discussion show after the news or something you would watch it so you would watch yeah the a team or you would watch airwolf but what i really enjoyed the most were the big kind of mini series family events okay the big big things like when v started yeah and they showed a mini series or even something as as silly as north and south or cane and abel those big blockbusting mini series the whole family would sit down as a family and there would not be a peep we might not understand it at the same time yeah my parents got a different outlook on it but we would also it was it was an event you know yeah and especially if it was on over 3 separate nights yeah nobody got you would sit in each night and watch that was a big big event yeah i guess it was a unifying force  anyways too and it was rare that obviously like i said i was an only child so i did not i kind of mom and dad watched the tv at night i would watch it during the day so i would say it was rare to find something that could unify all age groups  and all the kind of dynamics of a family so i guess and i just i was just going to say speaking to that one there was one in particular one tv show every week that we always sat down and we never missed but it used to terrify me and it was the incredible hulk yeah if you remember it and it the part when he would transform into the incredible hulk incredible yeah and you see his shirt bursting on his slee on his arms yeah he is turning green and his eyes change that was i was gone i was behind the couch every week without fail yeah i was gone behind the couch and i would not come out until he i could handle it while he was the hulk and i could handle it before he was the hulk i think it was the transformation and just when he looked up yeah and his eyes had changed his eyes i was just 0 my gosh yeah gone yeah gone i used to like that program a lot but i think everyone suffered from that moment cause it it is it changes gear quite quickly for kids program but i think everyone has that memory of the lookdown and then the lookup and the change 0 in the eyes and you just ran for cover you know so yeah that was a big show you would be you would be watching the tv going do not make him angry yeah you like him when he is angry i guess i kind of respected that that they made like i say tv shows for kids in a really adult format  so they did not hold back much and i do not think there is that kind of crossover these days where you would have something that is like a drama but it is aimed towards a kind of a younger audience that much you know no not so much i think you know the kind of nickelodeon style to go over with saved by the bell and all that yeah we grew up we grew up with with a more dramatic background especially with the british programming things like black beauty or yeah you know there was some beautiful period dramas that we would watch yeah we would actually sit down and watch as children was not there was like the secret garden and there was just some beautiful ones or even yeah annotations of that is which i do not think you see nowadays no but that is one thing i would say rte did quite well  they used to buy a lot of adoption of children is classics like i remember treasure island and stuff like that too they were really really good and the old mark twain stuff like huckleberry finn and tom sawyer i loved loved yeah huckleberry finn and tom sawyer yeah yeah yeah so that is one thing i credit them for they were just they were quite strong on kind of drama  but it was hugely kind of it was very seasonal it was usually during the summer when we had summer holidays and stuff like that too and my abiding memories of the summer would be tom sawyer but it was it must have been a european production because it was dubbed yeah so yeah that was really common and it i did not know understand what was going on because there was no subtitles granted we did not have to read it yeah but it used to scramble my brain i did not understand that there was dubbing in other countries so yeah after a while you get over it but you would be wondering why their lips are not actually in sync with what they are saying yeah you never realized that there were german or austrian or something but the same with heidi do you remember heidi yeah i do and i remember the dubbing was  absolutely atrocious  and it was really something you had to come to terms with over time  you did not notice after a long period of time but yeah it it was really really obvious and but i guess it was budgeting too they they kind of could not buy the cream or the crop or develop yeah their own stuff so they bought everything in but at least there was some kind of thought put into it and did you go through any kind of phases with cartoons when you were a kid like collecting stuff i know like stuff like care bears and stuff like that was huge and kind of i was a bit too old for care bears by the time they came around yeah my little pony i kind of came in at the end of the party with my little ponies but i did get one as a birthday present of a friend yeah but it it was not something i was really into i never really had any merchandise with respect to a cartoon like i think you were you were i think that was less common you were more star wars than that were not you yeah i i think what that was very generic and universal but i  think in ireland too when you were an irish kid merchandise and stuff that was not really a big part of of your daily life you know and it is again it was very much a uk kinda thing and yeah all that stuff you could kinda collect it seemed to kinda stop before i came over to ireland so it was 111213 really before i got into collecting stuff but  like star wars was a huge kind of event for my childhood and it was really good merchandise i think merchandise that you can actually go out and use your imagination with yeah is is a really good thing you know and that is what the stuff like star wars but yeah star wars seeing that for the 1st time was absolutely huge you know i think and personally when sky started their own morning saturday morning tv shows and i think they had dj cat for a while that was i was at european €0 tv or something euro channel yeah euro channel i think it came from amsterdam but it i remember that well that was  another layer of kind of very exotic stuff you had not seen cause there was all these cartoons from europe and that they were buying in and i remember a lot of japanese cartoons that was the 1st time i saw transformers yeah stuff like that and that was huge for merchandise because the toys came 1st and then yeah the cartoon so there was no shortage of transformers and then you had the cheaper rip off transformers that you get yeah yeah in the in the not so branded shops you know and yeah but that was the 1st time excuse me that was the 1st time i remembered there being a big kinda hullabaloo over merchandise 1st of all yeah transformers and then the teenage mutant ninja turtles turtles yeah  out of cartoons  that is one i never really took to i think i was a bit older yeah when they kind of came around but i remember being absolutely astounded when my cousins came home from england with actual transformers based on on the cartoon wow wow and i think that is when the whole kind of japanese animation kinda opened up  on this side of the world as well it is very common these days but it it seems so different and so new yeah i remember one that was a huge influence on me and it was rte who had bought it but it was a really old 70s japanese cartoon called battle of the planets 0 i and that was remember that yeah yeah i was very young like 567 but that was that was a huge cartoon going back we used to wait all day to see it and once a week around half 4 in the evenings that was the other thing too with irish broadcasting they never adhered to specific viewing times  they would say they would be showing a program or a cartoon at 50 clock and it might not appear till quarter past 6 or it was infuriating back then they used to just cut things off yeah but you had been waiting a week to see and into your earlier teens then did you start getting into more like american tv that must have been no yeah a big thing like big shows but i remember you know the sitcoms and stuff like that and it yeah probably the biggest one in my house growing up would have been the cosby show yeah that that was huge on a sunday yeah when that started you did not you never missed the cosby show even though my dad again he was an avid tv viewer so he always had something to say about the tv but he did not like the cosby show or bill cosby and used to insist that that was not funny and he could do a better job and yeah he probably could have yeah but it was it was really just viewing on a sunday evening definitely i guess before we know what we know now  it was yeah it was so big because it crossed all kinda cultures and kind of globally the whole family used to sit down to watch that show i guess you start paying more attention to more kinda dramatic stuff yeah i remember the things like miami vice and just  getting into that kind of more adult kinda glamorous world too when you were a kid that was kind of exciting and english channels produce a lot of good kind of cop shows and tv shows stuff that i used to watch when i was a kid did you have any yeah favorites like i i used to like dancing magpies yeah and that was a good one then as i got a little bit older and you know a bit more worldly wise i was able to understand more of what was going on and things like cracker i used to find that yeah really really good but that would have been above the kind of re we were looking at when we were kids it was not made for my age group but i used to love yeah the detective side of it and the investigative side of it but yeah you know when it came to the cop shows and stuff like that usually you would migrate over to things like hill street blues and yeah i think rte used to show that one was not it yeah they they bought yeah that quite wisely but  it was always on really late when i was young yeah it was kind of beyond bedtime it was usually around quarter to 11 or so so it was later when i got yeah into that stuff but one cop show i used to love when i was a kid you used to probably watch it too was t j hooke with william shatner yeah was that that was huge was that the girl from dynasty what is her name yeah heather locklear heather locklear that is it yeah and it was william shatner and another young kind of italian actor who used to do a lot of the heavy lifting and a lot of the running and chasing yeah but yeah that was a big big show and actually you have just reminded me of 2 shows that i loved growing up to american ones one was the fall guy 0 yeah that was i absolutely loved the fall guy i just yeah i would have given anything to have moved to california there and then i i was just amazed by the yeah place and the other was the dukes of hazzard 0 yeah i would forgotten about that that was huge yeah i used to love it that was huge in ireland so much so that i would refuse to get into the car if someone opened the door as a child i would only get in and out through the window yeah like the dukes boys i would only yeah climb in and out through the window and there was no way i was if you opened the door for me no you had to close the door roll down the roll down the window there was no electric window yeah back then roll it down and then fyuu and i would go i think that was really popular in ireland it seemed to click with 2 things which was cars and outlaw culture yeah it is the fact they used to make moonshine and smuggle and stuff i i think yeah it was it was a big show on this side of the world it was i think the irish liked it because like that we are always trying to get one up on the authorities and boss hog and yeah you know we used to have an affinity yeah it was a rebellious thing and then there was a good yeah looking girl in small shorts and that always helped with the viewership but yeah i just i just loved the car and i think yeah everybody in ireland would have killed to have had the general lee but it was never you would never see an american car like that in ireland it was ford fiesta or nothing yeah i did see some like ford escorts over the years that were modeled up  to look a bit like the general lee and that was as close as they came but yeah i guess again in back in ireland in those days everything from abroad seemed very exotic and very unobtainable just like you mentioned the fall guy and  that was a show about a stuntman yeah who lived in hollywood and he kind of solved mysteries on the side and stuff like that too it was like a private investigator on the side yeah but yeah the these are the 1st glimpses you get at places like california and that kind of lifestyle and it just seemed you know like you would never see the likes i guess for some too another huge show from when we were a kid would have been magnum pi with tom selleck yeah that was a big event i loved it i loved i loved the touch i loved the shorts i loved the ferrari yeah i think that was designed to have something for the moms everyone the dad and for the kid all yeah rolled into one  and it is something we watched recently as kind of adults and it has it has not held tom selleck has as an actor but my god it is it is really badly written and badly constructed but when we were kids we used to just be enthralled i think you were always just waiting for em to jump into that ferrari and drive and the rest  did not it did not matter well that is it and they always say you should never really revisit the stuff you watched when you were a kid cause it does not hold yeah the same magic you know yeah you start to see the flaws in it yeah i guess that is a good measure of it because when you do go back and look at certain things the really good stuff still holds up you know but yeah i guess a lot of that time was about distraction it was a lot of surface and not much depth 0 we we import the glamour but we never really had the substantive glamour that we wanted yeah so we we just yeah saw it on the tv yeah but listen i really appreciate having this chat i really enjoyed it it was lovely some of the things some of the things i genuinely forgotten about and you brought them back to mind like battle of the planets i think i might go and look at it youtube on youtube thanks again yeah yeah it is that is youtube it is all there so it is good to talk to you okay take care you too bye bye bye bye (EDACC-C61-00)

brother bob we also need a plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids she can scoop these things into 3 red bags and we will go t meet her wednesday at the train station how are you doing i am fine how are you doing i am really tired i had work from like 9 to 5 today and it was kinda steady at the store so there were cases where per persons were like there were cases where the store was like really empty then probably the next 5 minutes you see like 105 different families coming inside just to buy candy so it did really exhausting at one point but never so bad really cause we have had days where we were like really really busy if you understand what i am trying to say i do i do it wa well that really sounds exhausting that sounds like a lot yes comparing to me i i really have not done anything much all day other than chores and basically play games and back to bed what games i swear you are obsessed with games i very much am i i was playing mortal kombat and i am cleaning you play that on your phone or a pc or your television both i play on both it is really cool though you shou you should try them out no i am not really a games person you are not i a actually prefer to like go out and enjoy my surroundings instead of being stuck and looking at a computer screen or a phone screen every single day it is not that bad how about games do you play games like sports recreational actually i am not very athletic nor fit i do play tennis though 0 that is my you know i have always wanted to do tennis but i have never gotten the chance to actually play it is an it is perhaps you can teach me one day yeah when you are not busy sure probably it is not really that hard and seeing that you are like into sports i think that you probably might be a natural wow that well that is true especially so when you were a kid did you like used to play video games every day or were you like an active child like myself yes i i was an active child growing up and yeah i played video games but not so much as i do now when i was a kid i would most likely be at the river the beach you know doing stuff i loved going to the river that is one thing that i miss about jamaica the rivers like i can not wait to come back home but you really would not be enjoying the river much now i mean even though it is summer yeah it is summer but it is raining i doubt that jamaica is never cold it is 0 it trust me it is really cold right now nah it is not cold one thing though that i miss about being home like i can not wait to go back home in september is like the food the weather like it is either hot i do not know how to explain it but it is the the weather here is just so bipolar like for instance yesterday there was a thunderstorm right right and it was raining heavily like it was thunder lightning heavy showers and then like 5 minutes like i do not want to lie then like probably like 10 minutes after no probably an hour or 2 hours a probably a couple hours the sun came out like so bright like if it was jamaica it probably would have been raining for like 23 days i was like but that is kinda good though but i am just saying that it is so different and we are not used i am not used to this yeah you are right and you do not like it either  no you do not like it no no everybody seems to be talking about stranger things though have you seen it have you ever watched it stranger yes i am currently watching it right now what is it about like i want to start it but it is this i it is this it is like a it is not really scary it is not a scary film tell you that it is not really it is actually really fun and it mostly a it starts off with like kids like some 5 not 5 year old my bad probably like some 1012 year olds they discover some sorta monster  breaking the universe and so it is like superstitious or no is it like supernatural does it have like like what kind of supernatural things does it has like is like they are vampires werewolves aliens yes ghosts aliens most likely cause those things those things do not even have eyes so like do they have powers stuff like that yeah they do have powers so is it a case where kids are fighting supernatural beings because that probably would be good yes yes the kids fight different beings  it is really fun though good like i probably should watch that yeah you should you should definitely check it out how about you you have any tv show or cartoon you like or book no like i remember once i tried started watching like season one but it was not that really interesting so i like kinda stopped and then like since recently whenever i go on social media like tiktok instagram everybody is talking about season 3 for stranger things i am like what did i miss like why you know like how it get so popular so soon yeah or was it always popular i do not know i it is really good honestly it is great and the last series that i watched was fear the walking dead that is like a zombie yeah like a zombie apocalypse or whatever that word is yes sounds good sounds like something i would enjoy yeah it kinda it is good but the thing with those series show like is a zombie apocalypse so like the writers or the directors or the producers they like always kill off the main character and that really sucks because sometimes you get so attached to this character and then boom the next the next episode come out and then you realize that woah you have to go say goodbye to that character there and s that really make me sometimes like me get like uninterested in the show yeah yeah i really hate that but otherwise it is a good series i am currently waiting on the new part like i am hooked i love it and it realistic is a realistic show i am going to check it out for a fact you are not checking out anything i will no no i will i will for real i will all right so what is your favorite thing about university right now the favorite thing about networking i get to meet a lot of interesting people honestly 0 that is can not relate even especially the you know me like i i would so like are you having face to face classes or you like meet these people online no online but i do meet some of them face to face for class projects and stuff 0 i have never met anyone of my university students university classmates like i have been going to university for like what 2 years now and i have never seen any of those students faces hopefully next year we can go in face to face do you prefer like face to face or do you like online schooling i mean honestly i wish i wish there was like a mixture where i could have you know both so like a hybrid type of set up yeah maybe you know i think my school is going to do that for the next school the next school year  honestly i would not mind because i am tryna like go to school part time and then like get a s a job on the side so like if it is hybrid you know that would be more easier to like accommodate a job so you are like what were you feeling to switch from full time to part time or no no way well part time honestly i do not know i just think that i do not want to go to school in the night yeah cause at my school you can either be a day student or a evening student 0 we do not say night we say evening student evening student so like for your daytime your classes will probably finish like 4 the latest and evening student your class will probably finish like 8 the latest in the night and i just think that i should not be at school at 8 in the night exactly cause that is that is mad long if you ask me but ca if you have to do it you have to do it but personally me i would not learn shit yeah cause i i would be tired that is past tiring i feel like at night your brain is more relaxed so you are not yeah really functioning well probably it is the opposite for other persons but for me i know when it is night i am going to sleep so you know i i am currently doing summer i am currently doing summer classes and most of my really class is at night that sucks yeah how many courses are you doing in the summer i am doing 3 courses in the summer and when do they finish like august no they finish in mid next month mid next 0 month that is good it is like july the 18th so 0 so like why are you doing summer classes did you fail yeah i did i did fail a course 0 my god damn so yeah and if i wanted i started getting back grades too like i am not really pleased with my grades either but i did not fail anything but i barely passed well at least you passed exactly the course because the one i failed i just failed by like 3% 0 my god that that is that is tough well i guess that is kinda good so cause like 0 my god is that a bird a bird you see a bird yeah you like birds no i yeah i i like animals but not wild animals cause i am not actually going to every day okay so next topic if you could go on a holiday anywhere where would you go and why i would definitely go i have so much places like my top 3 places that probably that i would like to go is definitely dubai then mexico which one that was what is that and mexico can and then punta cana it is like this place in dom in the dominican republic have you heard about it punta canta i am not sure it is spanish for something hey we got we got we got 2 similar places 0 dubai everyone wants to go to dubai dubai dubai and mexico but in cancun i would like to go to cancun you would like to go where cancun mexico cancun mexico s 0 yeah that is yeah that is where i want to go too i would like mexico is like really beautiful but i also hear like it is kinda dangerous too  but everywhere is dangerous like every you are not yeah safe anywhere and crime and crime is everywhere so you know it is just you just pray you are not in the wrong place at the wrong time well i want to go to i would love to go to bora bora have you seen like pictures of bora bora before no i have never seen pictures of really it is like crap i think i have heard about it though yeah it is like the resorts with the above the above the the hotel rooms are above seawater and them have like glass bottom floors so like when you are in the room you can see like you can basically see yeah it is really pretty it is really beautiful honestly that is definitely on my to go to list i think i would like to to see singapore 0 i have heard about singapore is that one of those cold countries right yeah i think it is one of those yeah new zealand is pretty pretty too you know that new zealand and australia switzerland yes and australia but like yeah switzerland is really great i it is switzerland especially it is so cool so i was thinking like next semester i would probably like live on campus have you considered living on campus yes i have live on campus i am actually currently a part of the hall committee for the campu for the hall that is good so do you like get discount on all prices or is it free for you no it is it is not free but you do get discounts that is good yeah cause boarding is very expensive 0 it is it it very much is that is like 230 something dollars on a per semester or is that like per annum for like the entire year but that is that is at my school it is like a 114 if you are if you are trying to get a single dorm if you are going to get a roommate it is going to be like 74 but i am definitely not getting a roommate yeah neither am i i am i am say i stay by the way are you guys like allowed to bring people on dorms yes we are we are it we just got to respect like the time like 10 p m it goes quiet just do not be loud any time after 10 that is but you are free to go and come as you like 0 cause i am definitely coming on your camp by your dorm definitely i am so looking forward to that i do not think my school would allow that though no just like you see i know teacher colleges they are very much strict they are very strict with that so i do not know exactly but like i am paying all that money why can not i bring my friend over right i have no idea i guess they are just trying to prevent certain you know others who are treating but honestly i am not even that type of person i will never bring a boy over just friends yes exactly i am so hungry really what did you eat today i have not eaten as yet really it is a ha yeah literally since today 0 this morning for breakfast i had an cup cup noodles that is a shrimp cup noodles that is  an egg and sausage and do not tell me that is a lot it is really not it is not a lot this morning i ate toast just toast just toast like like french french french toast no like i put the bread in the toaster and then i put but butter on it and then i had a cup of tea 0 so that is good i like i like toast and then for lunch i had rice and was it it was red beans rice and beans with a patty a jamaican beef patty it is actually good it really kinda taste like the the original juicy beef patty that we have over there but like the crust you know like juici beef crufs crust is kinda like crispy you know like it has that crispy crunchy taste to it texture to it sorry  but like the one my favorite is the ch cheese though 0 my god the cheese patty the cheese is bomb as hell cheese patty expensive the cost of cheese patty is like what now probably like what is it going to 300 or mistaken 0 my god $300 for a cheese patty is it 3 or am i tripping you got to be tripping probably i am i probably am you are i th no i think it is it is actually 3 i do not think i am tripping imagine i remember we could buy patties for like a $100 each when mother is just you remember when the mother is was the mother is restaurant opened i think we were in like high school freshmen probably freshmen or even or even elementary school yeah and you could get a patty for like a $100 now it is crazy $300 for a cheese patty $300 that is a and the worst part is one patty is not even enough exactly but you know you know you it is great you love it so you are going to keep buying it all the time like no matter how much can not afford to eat patties again like it is come to that case patty prices are too high too high we need to protest actually it is high but are we going to stop buying it no no i am going to stop buying it cause i am not going to stop i am sorry i am going to stop cause $300 you will not  trust take take kfc for instance girl kfc is so high and it tastes so bad like why do they keep raising the prices for that awful chicken i do not i do not know but i am going to keep buying that zinger box you like kfc i do i do i am guilty as well what is your what is your favorite thing to get in kfc but lately honestly honestly lately i have been having a liking for like popeye is 0 i tried popeye is here in america it is not good it is not good it is not good and the funny thing is i have never like ate popeye is in jamaica so i do not know why i bought it over here cause i do not really like fast food used to it chicken cause it is just grease you you really think so huh you do not how about how about pizza yeah i love pizza who does not but i will pay any amount for pizza like i do not really eat pizza that do you like pineapples on pizza i do i tried it no  no no no no pineapples do not belong on pizza do not belong on pizza okay you tried it you tried it no i would not like that you should trust me you shou i thought i would not like it either because i am girl like come on this is i like pizza why why pizza is supposed to be cheesy spicy meaty why the hell are you going to add pineapple to that that is like an horrible combination but kinda it is crazy though there was cheese 0 i did do you remem did you do you remember when we went to that mexican restaurant i think it was what was the name chilita chilitas chilitos 0 yeah the food was 0 the food was like trash but i am actually i am actually glad we went there because the only thing i would actually go back there for is that chicken is that chicken taco yeah probably that is all i am not i like their pina coladas too like they they and serve pina coladas yeah but i tried this mexican restaurant here i thank  i think it is called chipotle i am not sure cause it is like mexican i and i can not pronounce it but it is really good chick fil a no not chick fil a chick fil a it is not chick fil a it is chipotle something like that i bought like a burrito bowl and i got like huh i saw you post about it yeah it is good it is good that is great i got like damn white rice chicken cheese sour cream lettuce a little tomato and they like they put everything in a bowl like and then they sh it is so good sh like honestly chilita was just not it in terms of mexican food but the real deal is here like whatever they are doing at chilitas in jamaica is not it girl this that is why it is called lady is dog it is like it is actually jamexican hey it is actually jamexican that is why cause in a way jamaican does not go with mexican they do not have the right recipe there at chilita cause it was exactly i really just en i really just enjoyed the chicken that is all i that beef i do not mess with that at all that beef is not it yeah like that was not it for real for real all right so h a what did you do today what did i do like i said before i did not really do much today other than do chores play games chill back and that is it 0 but i did do some assignment cause i got this 12 page essay to like get rid of so a 12 page essay yeah damn i know right i can not remember the last essay that i wrote school ended in like probably april for me but tomorrow like i got i got tomorrow is my day off at my 1st job but i got to go to my 2nd job i do housekeeping it is hard it is it is like because i do not have like my my my ss yet i have to do like jobs that are willing to hire me and sadly housekeepers are only jobs that willing to hire but i get my ss tomorrow so that is good i can quit housekeeping but i will not quit it until i get like a better job like a easier job cause honestly house i think housekeeping is maybe it is not hard but to me it is hard because like it is the 1st time i am doing it so for example the other day i went to work i was given s 11 rooms to clean i totally understand 11 rooms and mind you i start at 9 in the mornings like everybody else and then i have another job at 4 so like i have to stop working before 4 so i can get a l at least half hour to go to my next job cause i got to walk to my next job so i managed to clean like 9 of the rooms so i had like 2 remaining when i am at my 2nd job my supervisor from the the housekeeping position is going to text me like hey why did not you clean all your rooms today i was like you know i have another job that i got to get to i can not i could not finish that in that amount of time if you understand that cause the rooms are really big no not all the rooms are big but like the king size rooms they are really big and that day i was given like 6 king size rooms to clean and one of those room probably take like 45 minutes cause you can not spend like a hour cleaning one room cause i guess that is not being productive in their eyes i guess so like i have to be like in and out the rooms and it is really hectic having to spread 9 beds in one morning sweep 9 floors clean 9 bathroom mop 9 rooms and empty 9 garbage bins like and trust me people are nasty it is not easy  i can not wait to quit housekeeping i am not like honestly i have a a level of respect for housekeepers now cause they have to do so much it is not easy being a housekeeper yeah it really is terrible so tomorrow is just going to be rest for me and then when i get home i am should probably just going to eat i made pasta since evening so i am probably just going to eat that again pause huh what was that pause (EDACC-C49-00)

cult stuff though i am not going to lie like midsummer yeah this idea reminds me of a i i took part in a study once i i this is like 1st year of college and what is it called we were gi we had we have this kind of like online network in ucd where you like you kind of take part in research and then if you get enough credits and you can get people to take part in your your research for you then 0 that is kinda cool so it is kind of a scam because like i did all the work and then nobody took part in my study but yeah my fault i guess but yeah like like but when they when you sign up for a study and then send you much information saying like your your code will be this and like do not use your name while you are in the study and stuff and like it is really important to keep privacy and stuff and do not disclose information and stuff and then i i remember going to one study once and then like i would like knock on the door and then the person that is there was like 0 hey is this and then she just says my name like i had had like my code written down on my arm and stuff saying like do not do not tell them make make sure and identify yourself by the code and not your actual name but then they were like knew exactly who i was and stuff and so that was kinda like whoa a bad start just to the study but huh well like i i i i it actually turned out it was not an issue it was just like a formality but it was pretty funny 0 maybe the whole name thing and this thing is a bit of a formality are we breaking the fort wall by doing this stuff i think we are i hope it is not too weird for the people on upworkcom where we can see you  and another 0 yeah 0 yeah it says that we have our names on zoom as well but and so we have some questions that to go through well i i do not have my name i have my mom is name so apparently i am still logged in as her so so the games when you were a kid what kind of games did you used to play and is there one that you remember well football you are

forms of football one of my mates like he lost his shit online playing fifa once because do you know the way you can buy like all those microtransaction stuff 0 yeah he spent something like 0 he must have spent over 50600 quid close to a grand i would say and like i came up to his house one day and he was like 0 i was like geez connor you are team is like really good because you know the way you build like your own team and it is i was like you have got a really good team do you ever spend money on this and he goes nah nah not at all man and i look over in the corner of the room and he has got like a massive stack of all these things that he used to buy and it is like basically in like a game case but they are all €20 each or something like that and he had at least like 50 to 60 of these things i was a 0 my god yeah i i remember hearing before they and yeah those games are like the microtransactions and stuff that are free apparently yeah they make their money off like one of the player base which is kinda like depressing like it is like is it is it one in a 10 a 100 people that is kinda just super addicted to buying stuff and then they spend so much money that it pays for their meeting 90 people which is kinda like crazy when you think about it like it is like they are spending so much money that like they only need one out of a 100 people to actually pay money which is sort of like a almost exploitative but yeah kind of funny as well whe when i was working in woodie is like this guy who was working at he was like 0 james i am not in a good mood and i would say 0 why what is wrong and he was like my girlfriend is after spending like over a grand on candy crush damn yeah yeah 0 my and this guy was making minimum wage and he had like 3 kids to provide and stuff like that and he was saving up for his motorbike license or something i was 0 my god and she was he was like yeah i only found out last night i was like 0 it is such a weird one just to be into as well candy crush yeah yeah but but apparently that that is like a big problem that people like burn through their inheritan b b burn through their like children is inheritance by playing candy crush that is pretty badass though fairplay to them that is pretty badass yeah that is what i want to be like when i am old old and frail can you win money on candy crush though surely not i am not sure i think you can score extra points and stuff but yeah it is do you make your money back off of it i do not think so because like i think that children play it as well so like it is hardly gambling  here is an idea though is like a casino for children 0 yeah i like that yeah new business idea well you could leisureplex is basically like that though is not it it is kinda it is actually what it is actually what it is is not it because basically like not only that they just win shitter prizes as well yeah like it is never about the money ever yeah it is just like 0 well done you have won a stuffed teddy you have after paying €600 for that yeah you have won a diseased stuffed teddy well done yeah that will go in the back of your cupboard in a week is time i still remember i was going there once with a our friend who works at pfizer i think we were walking it was like well it was like late at we were was it worth bringing you own beer building and i remember walking in like getting my id ready and then then the bouncer was like 0 go on ahead i do do not need to see your id so i was like walking along and then like your man tries to come with me then he like blocks him with his arm and says like you can not come in whoa whoa he is he is like he is he is like show me your id but like cause like yeah he obviously thought i i looked old enough to not not to have an id but he thought that your man did not so he like well he proper put his arm out and stopped him like whoa would you like to be a bouncer i do not think i would be good at it i feel like i would be too like 1st of all too weak but also too like not too ethically challenged i guess if somebody was like i have to consider the pros and cons of beating somebody up before i would do it you have to look a little bit more badassed i think you got to you got to remove one of your eyes and get like do you know the way those guys will like make their teeth sharper like make you know little like fangs or something kinda like filing your teeth to make you look a little more yeah you look a little bit more scary then there used to be a bouncer who worked in the academy and she was like an old lady but like she was like proper like stern like she would be she would have been like a good school teacher you know those kinda like scary old catholic ladies who are like you know like just do the they are like they are just terrifying and i do not know it it would give an example of but like she was like a bouncer in the academy and like she used to be proper like certain people are like i i think that is the one person you really do not want to mess with yeah it is the most dangerous person in the world is like old vicious ladies but you know the big bouncers are funny like and the people i have heard of who have gotten like beaten up by bouncers for no reason but they always say it is for no reason but then can you trust them i wonder if that is just an irish thing or is it like everywhere yeah i do not know yeah like i my lecturer was telling me once that his mate was a bouncer and one day he was working there and some lad was like tryna get in and he was like 0 sorry bro but you can not be doing that because i forget what your man was doing i think he was just spitting on the bouncer or something and anyway he goes back in with the bouncer inside the door for a sec and as he comes back out there is the lad comes back with a fucking shotgun  yeah yeah wait is this is this in america or is this or where is it no it was in ireland it was in ireland 0 yeah  yeah anyway so he gets back inside dives on the ground and your man starts firing shots through the door and then runs off damn i so i thought he was tryna like use the shotgun to get into the bar and then he was going there and like stand and get a drink with this this giant gun next to him that would definitely work that would have been the better option i think i would have done that you would have brought a gun out well no it is just you know to have the feel of that power that is tru true yeah that is probably the best way to kind of feel like a man  carry a weapon around with you no wonder other countries have gun laws in them yeah that will be cool i remember talking to a friend of ours that you can probably guess who by that you were saying how he thinks ireland should legalize guns 0 yeah i know exactly who you are talking about but yeah it was funny it this is years and years ago and i remember like i remember like like this is like you know maybe like 4th or 5th year in school and like like he kinda like he had it pretty well thought out and like i remember kind like being like that is a terrible idea and then he was like why and i was like i am not sure as you know it was one of those funny things like you know when you like you kinda like know intuitively that you are right but like you can not really the other person clearly knows the case better than you but anyway that was funny maybe you were just caught out connor you could never you know your head just did not wrap around that you were wrong that is true no like kinda like like i like i and i knew that your man was like had a better case than me but he was also kind of unconvincing like you know the idea of just legalizing guns in ireland you known what i mean like with all the problems we have here yeah maybe it would solve some of them maybe it would like solve like youth delinquency i dunno with all all the people i grew up with i would not want them to have a gun i know yeah they are the last people i could ever want to have a gun yeah yeah it is kind just like it is not really a problem to me so it sounds terrible idea like why introduce it as a as a problem yeah like i was saying to you earlier like like all the all my colleagues are over in america for a big conference and like they are like in some mad doggy neighborhood in california it was like san francisco but apparently like you can not wear red in san in california did you ever hear about that what like if if you are wearing red outside then you risk being mistaken for a member of the blood gang and people will shoot you yeah what no cause like cause like they have these like gang shootings and stuff and like the blood gang always wear red to identify themselves that is why i imagine if you are kind of just like walking around in like a red jumper and then dude is like he is a blood get him and then they shoot you 0 my god i do not know if it is true someone told me that once i do not know if it is true but like it would be pretty funny if you were just kind of like wearing like if you worked in like xtra vision and you got shot cause you were in san francisco damn no i would think i could get away with it no i do not really wear wear red but i think what color was y your old supervalu uniform 0 that was red yeah yeah imagine if you were going to work and you just got shot cause some dude thought you were like a member of a gang that has got to got to be embarrassing this entire supervalu is run by the bloods yeah it is it is like a blue one for the crips like a blue supermarket tecos versus supervalu yeah turf war but there is a whole thing about aldi versus lidl like apparently they have like a territorial dispute 0 that sounds bad ass but yeah yeah it is always like a aldi next to a supervalu to a lidl like apparantly do like whenever they open up one in some location then the other supermarket will open up another one in the same location that is amazing yeah i do not know what the point is but like they kinda just want to be the number one do you think it will ever be like an all out war yeah like right now it seems like a standoff you know there is just kind of  testing the waters but one day it might like break out it would be cuban missile crisis kind of situation yeah yeah sort of like 0 wait maybe i should not mention that yeah it is a delicate balance to be maintained for yeah i was going to mention i know that a certain country but i do not know if i should be allowed do that yeah maybe there p people running this study i do not know really you know i do not know anyway it is the next question let us be honest like everything when you were younger was good that is true although i mean you know you know what when i was when i was like really young then i would never watch things that were live action because i thought that like anything for live action was for adults and so i could never watch like drake josh or something like that 0 yeah no i was the same i do not even watch it had it had to be it had to be a kinda a cartoon or it had to be kinda like yeah cartoon or ani animation in some way and then i was like 6 it was kind like hold on a 2nd it had to be spongebob had to be you know your samurai jack fairly oddparents maybe yeah you got 2 right 2 right staring norm mcdonald he was a genie that that was it no way yeah yeah was he actually in that he he was like a genie who i think there was an episode for like timmy like gets rid of his fairy godparents and then he replaces them with a a really sleezy genie he finds and like the genie was voiced by norm yeah i would just prefer if timmy is wish was to replace his fairy godparents with just norm mcdonald yeah yeah have that for an episode that would have been a better system i think we should be the writers on that show is the show going to still go ahead i think it is it is probably ended now apparently they rebooted it but it is like a girl now or something is it in like a gritty realistic remake did you see they are making a horror film based on winnie the pooh called blood and honey yeah you were showing me that is yeah wild what the hell he must be in the public domain you can not really like yeah yeah either that or like they are about to get sued into oblivion i have to piglet we should make like a frozen like elsa frozen horror movie no we could go for that i really do not want to do that well actually that must have been my unconscious mind cause there actually was a horror film called frozen where it is 6 months stuck on ski lift 0 it was like from like 2009 years like that but i remember being in like xtra vision years and years ago and someone was like exchanging a copy of frozen the horror film for frozen the children is film cause they were like told by their like wife to pick up a copy of frozen from the dvd store and then she got the wrong one it is just the one where it is like someone is stuck in a ski lift in the the storm are you sure your kids want to watch this okay yeah yeah look here is ola 0 my god that is brilliant yeah yeah no honestly if i had a kid like i would just show them all the greats it does not matter what age it is  i would show them django unchained or i would show them godfather and who knows maybe your kid would be cooler for it  maybe he would just be like exactly like vito corleone or something he would like adopt the mannerisms of the characters hey ma ma  just show him all of sopranos yeah that is going to be you when you are older that is my fucking boy i dunno i dunno if you could have any accent what would it be any accent ooh yeah cause they seem yeah to be really focused on accents here yeah i think it is a good a good accent is you you know how people when people do not speak english fluently and then they learn they are very into english so that like like people will like i say if you are german you can learn english e english british english or american english 0 yeah yeah but you can always tell but you know i think is a nice accent is people who have who have a british a british italian accent so they are from they are from italy but they learn british english if that makes sense and they have kind of like if they have cause it sounds kind of like they have like a posh voice but they have a bit of like a mediterranean twang to it no i have never heard of this accent what the fuck yeah there used to be like a researcher i was working when they had like a proper like they were from italy but they had like a proper like posh british accent but like you could tell that they were like also italian it was they were they were strange accents it is hard to it is kinda hard to explain but like that is pretty cool how about you what would your accent of choice be scottish maybe scottish nice you are appeasing it is pretty cool though like yeah remember there was that little girl in that room she was she had a really thick scottish accent it was pretty funny i heard you saying that yeah she would knock on the door she is like martha are you coming out to play she be knocking out of like a door and then she look through the letter box an go i know you are in there we have you surrounded yeah i know i i i remember when i was edinburgh when i was like 14 with the scouts and like there just one dude who like worked in like a newsagent i was saying to you earlier like irn bru was great like i wish you could get it more in ireland but like i remember i wanted to get like a kind of irn bru off this guy and i him for it he was like regular irn bru i was like yeah like he was proper like deep rural scottish and so like kinda similar to a kinda like if you have like a real like a deep rural irish accent 0 jeesus people like outside of ireland can not understand you god fekin look at that i always find it funny when you see people like you will see like a lecturer you see like a a video on youtube of somebody speaking in like a deep irish accent and then everybody in the comments is like can someone annotate this i can not understand it like you you you you can kinda get it like you can understand what you are saying but nobody else can cause of how deep their accent is my my dad is uncle lived in tipperary his whole life in the same house and he feckin had the thickest accents that i have ever ever heard and not only that he had like one of those old kind of voices that sounds like you know it is kind of dying and it is like this sort of but then he was also like basically deaf as well so he had no idea what he was saying he was like and you are like 0 yeah 0 yeah yeah do you know that sort of thing when you do not understand something and you just kind of nod your head and go ah yeah i know you what you are doing i know yeah i wonder if th that is kinda upsetting for them though cause like you know because eventually they are going to figure out that they are they are not getting through to you yeah i do not know it is funny imagine if they are like there is there is a fire you got to go you got to run for your life there is a fire and you are like yeah ah yeah i mean you just seem like the most chill dude ever and so and it is the most chill bloke in the world that is like a classic like sitcom scene where like someone is speaking in like a random language and then the other person is going to pretend to understand it but then they have like subtitles that kind of give us context and it is like yeah that is funny i could definitely see that as like a joey from friends thing or something they had a scene like that in air in airplane you know the film airplane which is like 0 yeah yeah which is like excuse me young sir and stuff is joey still a thing or is that like dead i dunno i dunno i dunno much about joey i think i never actually it is jive is their word for cool 0 is it i thought it was like a whole like might as well just be a dialect it is just like slang that people use maybe i do not know much about jive i mean i was in anfield once and you in the like the shop the gift shop they have like a little book in there that you can buy and it is all the chants that liverpool use at their games nice but who in their right mind is taking out that book of going and should we ride a should we sing verse 5 of this book please there is like the hyme sheets in mass where they are like you know today we will be doing hym number 2 and everyone is like let us get this do you remember that in father ted when they when they have the the book for football for old ladies and like missus missus doyle and their friends are all reading through it and then they are like they are all standing round the book at the match and then they are going like go on my son that is unreal 0 i like that so where where would you go in the world if you could go anywhere in the world  you know it is it is weird i was i was looking a the ryanair website today and i kinda realized how cheap flights can be if you book them well in advance i was kinda thinking like i te i technically could go anywhere in the world you can do it if it is well in advanced or like the next day yeah depends yeah it is kinda like i saw a tweet once where somebody was like i can just go like i am i am an adult so i can just go to the store and buy a whole cake and eat it all but like every day i do not it is a weird kind of like a self restraint to it feck it let us go to like in jamaica tomorrow yeah let us do it where would where would would ja jamaica be your your country of choice that to go to or no i think i would go to rwanda nice because that place is a bit of messed up in the day and i want to know if it is okay now cause you do not hear about it you you would go there to check you would not just google there you do not hear about it anymore you know that is true or what about do you know i heard ethiopia you are not allowed to do journalism there or something do journalism yeah yeah 0 that is crazy is it ethiopia yeah there was like 2 guys from i think it was either iceland or finland they are basically the same place but okay well probably not but you know they but they went they got kidnapped because they were doing journalism there and they were 0 really yeah that is crazy they were kidnapped there for a while and like they were locked in like different rooms and they would like tap on the walls to each other and they said like as long as i could hear my mate i knew i was like going to be okay that is nice and they got out in the end of it did they get out in the end really i was watching a a film recently the diving bell and the butterfly about about your man who like had locked in syndrome he was like totally paralyzed and like he could not do anything except for blink but like apparently like it is a true story like the the film is a true story but it is a true story in the film where he like gave up his seat on an airplane to one of his colleagues who was going on a trip and then the plane was was hijacked by terrorists and then they like took your man hostage and so like it was it was kinda like the in the film they kinda had like a whole subtext where like your man was like your man it was like was held hostage for 5 years before he was released but like your man visits him in the film and he was like you know like i was kind of like a prisoner too and now you are a prisoner because he is you know like thi this guy was a prisoner the terrorist and then the other guy was a prisoner in his own body i guess so jesus kinda a few things but that it is interesting like a that is like a is it a true story yeah i think so like your man in the film like wrote an an a autobiography by blinking so like like his like editor would like read him the alphabet and then he would like blank whenever he got jesus some letters yeah that is so feckin tedious 0 my god yeah but you know what it took him 3 months to write the book which is insane he would do it for 3 but most people can not even do that like yeah that is the thing like i have been working on articles for for like 6 months and they are not ready but jesus i guess though in a way he had not anything else to do all day like you kinda have to focus on that but so you are saying if you were paralyzed you would be able to write your articles a lot faster i mean if i if i had nothing nothing else to do i guess so it is kind of like like back when i had covid then i you know i got a bunch of work done cause i had no nowhere to go 0 yeah trapped in one room all day not that that i am saying that my struggles with covid were anything like like if you had a a full body paralysis but like no i am pretty sure that is what you are trying to say you are trying to relate to this guy it is on the record it it is kinda inspiring though that your man was like able to like have a reasonably kind of and yeah part of the reason why the film was so was so was so inspiring was cause like your man is kind of like he is not that likable he is kind of like just constantly complaining and stuff and like but he is it is very kind of human yeah like you know sometimes they hear about a story is that is an inspirational story but if you kinda like that is just showing off you know but like your man in the film like there is like a scene where he is like he is like watching tv and stuff and then someone turns off the tv by by mistake and he kind like caught on maybe to like turn it back on he is kind like 0 you goddamn this person that your man in his head and like yeah that is that is very kind of humanizing i guess he is like yeah how can some people have like the most eventful lifes ever i cannot get that like that guy is like life seems pretty eventful yeah it is interesting like that is man not that i want something like that in my life but yeah who do you think has had the most eventful life i do not think we are meant to mention names but i do not know maybe neil armstrong he seemed a pretty eventful life yeah he was actually he was like on the moon and stuff yeah it is pretty crazy yeah he kinda like he went far out far out dude far out dude remember like julius cesar though like he was like he like conquered most of the world and then he like tried to be a politician and they killed him there that is going to be pretty donald trump had a pretty eventful life considering he has been the host of a tv show and then the president so that is all that you could want from life what about your man reagan as well was not he like a tv star or something he was like a movie star yeah he was like in a bunch of cowboy movies what the hell that is wild yeah he was in the good the bad and the ugly no no joking what the fuck well he wishes he wishes he plays clint eastwood is character 0 he was a stunt double for clint eastwood yeah yeah there was a picture of him on online of him with a monkey like a movie he was in cause you know like back in like the 50s and like movies would be like the funniest things ever if somebody like had a monkey had a monkey yeah simple times i guess yeah but it is planet of the apes you know when you think about people and they make mo movies about monkeys and stuff maybe we should go back to that yeah mean they had all those new planet of the apes movies where like they had like all the monkeys and stuff they were there speaking english yeah but they were not really did the monkeys talking in the old movies i do not remember yeah yeah that is all they did they were like much more intelligent at the start it is pretty weird how like they kept using english yeah you think they would use something a a bit better they would like figure out some kind of new monkey language or yeah right you know i heard that in some places in africa and i know africa is a big fecking and place but they use like they only have like a couple of words for like a color 0 yeah that is crazy is not it yeah but so like green and blue are like the same thing it is just like the one word for like both i remember in college there was we watched a video about where there is there is a certain tribe that have seems like 66 different words for the color green depending on its shade what but like it is crazy cause you what they can d d they have done studies where they show people and get people to pick out whether 2 colors are the same or different yeah and like and by by ma matter of shade i guess like so they did show you like you know dark red versus light red you would say like different but these people from this tribe they have multiple words for green kinda like pick out various little differences in shade 0 other people can not tell the difference from whoa which is crazy th they can be like that that one is definitely darker and then they are right and stuff do you think that is because their whole language has enabled them to visualize it better i think so that that must be the reason cause like they they probably have more reason to pay attention to color differences and so they can kind of pick these things out nicely that is pretty wild i do not know maybe we should start doing that having more more words for the letter for the color green yeah yeah did you ever like make like a secret language with a mate or something no i remember there a philosopher ludwig wittgenstein he was talking and he wrote extensively about the problems of a private language how it is impossible to have a private language but like what do you mean well he thought that like i guess he did not mean a secret language between you and your friend but he thought that he thought that it was impossible to like have a secret language just for yourself because we need language as like a tool for social referencing and stuff and so and okay so just for one person yeah i guess that makes sense it is a famously annoying argument to try to like comprehend i i am still not really great with it but like yeah yeah i do not like that kind of like you do not like no no not after you said that i do not know him but i do not like him you do not know him personally you know there is this book that they found like a while ago i do not know when but it was like a really old book and it had like a weird language in it nice and they managed to disipher it and it turns out like it was like a weird coded language for like a cult but there were some 0 no yeah but there were some letters that were like did not mean anything but they are just thrown in there to throw you off and there is some letters yeah and there were some letters where like all vowel like one symbols that looked like a vowel actually only meant like one vowel which is very interesting to me that is weird that that is like a that is kind of interesting that they were trying to throw people off but then like yeah like what was it what were they writing about like i do not know it was like a the the roles that you have to do for the cult and like what members like what a a member i suppose kind of like a a guidebook and stuff yeah yeah yeah sort like a scout handbook i guess but like for their weird thing i like the most culty thing i have ever seen is when i went to the initiation while in portugal i think that was you think that 0 yeah yeah that was could happen there but basically it is just like they they do not know but it is basically just like an 8 story like tower but inmersed in the ground so instead of like going up the tower you go down into like a ground there difference this does not seem right it like it is almost they are they are already finished but they are going to be like hold on a 2nd but like the that one was only built like a 100 years ago just before like world war ii but there is a much older one because at the bottom like you get to like a cave and you go through the cave and then you can find like an even older version so i am not sure if that was like there before all like the rich portuguese people got there you know like before that that family set up their palace around there was that when you saw like a recreation or something or was it or what like what do you mean a recreation i do not know i do not know no i i huh it is just like 2 old wells down there but one is even older so i wonder if like that is like the well that they used to use and then they built a newer one so like how old is this cult we do not even know  they are not even like a 100 sure if it was for a cult but it looks kinda cultish to me yeah cause that is when they are using it like when you think about it what do they do when they get to the bottom though that is what i want to know yeah and it is a weird one they probably have you blindfolded and you have to stick something in your mouth or something yeah th that is part of their rituals maybe as a good dentist office that is why you put things in your mouth yeah hey yeah that is pretty cool that is like the coolest dentist you could ever go to if you have to go down like a tower like that underground yeah that would be cool like i wonder if there is like a doctor who has like a big castle ooh no that that and then i would respect it that would really scare people from the dentist yeah like a giant castle like i mean i personally i have not gone to a dentist in like 10 years 0 really you have not gone for like a checkup or anything no no no no dude it is just because i am sort like well i have brushed my teeth you know i mean they are pretty yellow they are not falling out though i guess so yeah so you know as long as they are not hurting like it is grand yeah that is cool no i mean i mean it is kind of miserable going but i guess it is all in the service of higher values everyone tells me i should do otherwise but i think the more people tell me that i should do it the more i do not want to do just piss them off well that is kinda like that those things about celebrities where they are like everybody told me to give up and i kept on going and now look where i am yeah do not know who you want there when you have no teeth yeah i dunno i yeah i think like there is lots of things i have not done that lots of people would say like 0 you should really do that you know like like like go to the dentist kind of things or kinda like you know like watch eurovision kind of things both but i get a lot less suggestions for eurovision because i think most people go this is god awful that is true yeah except for my girlfriend and her sister i ended up watching yeah girls love eurovision i feel like particularly yeah they love it they love it they love it i dunno i dunno everyone i ever talked to was big into eurovision they all like they are always kinda like either obsessed with it or they they do not watch it at all like and you know my girlfriend she really liked like all the the the slow ones you know where they have like a guy being like all professional and stuff but i just like when you have got some crazy fecking shit out there yeah yeah people were saying that there is like a song called hypa hypa by this band called eskimo callboy they are like a german band it is kinda like there there is this like song where it is like a mixture of like a 80s pop song with like a metal song woah and then like they did a music video where they like dressed up in like mullets and mustaches and stuff and like proper like 80s kinda like jumpsuits and stuff that is and everyone was saying it would be like a gass eurovision song cause like it starts off kinda like a pop song and it goes this deep metal section then then back and forth then for the rest of the song my favorite one from the eurovision was moldova but mainly just because they decided to go with a violin a guitar rapping and an accordion now what can get better with that yeah like i wish more rappers would do that sick yeah well i was in portugal and we were in this town called cascai or cashcais or something like that but like they were all doing football volleyball the beach which was pretty badass but just from down from that there was a guy who was like playing on an accordion and he was like the best thing i saw all holiday he had like a small little dog like it was only this big and like a small little cat wearing pearls in the buggy beside him it was like what is this this is so wild and random where would you ever see this other than like grafton street yeah i guess yeah we should get into street performing like you know those guys who are like statues but then they kinda like if you give a coin they just do a dance for you ooh i will be doing that maybe i could be a fire eater that would be kind of cool that would be a good one yeah yeah or one of those sword sword swallowers yeah there is always a guy on grafton street he was he is he has like a unicicle and he juggles knives but like you you never see him do it cause he will spend the whole time there just saying come on now guys come on make some donations there guys come on throw some money into my little thing you know i swear i will do it i will swear i will do it now yeah but then like literally like and he will like call out people on the street he would be like you there in the blue hash come over here and check this out now you will not believe what you will see but yeah like i i always tend to meet people in town around grafton street and like i like i will have to start meeting them somewhere else cause like your man is always there and he always just annoyed me so much i i was there once and he was setting up and so he had not built up a crowd yet and he was literally just there like asking people to come over and stuff i am like 0 man it was so so cringe yeah but he is doing what he loves you know he is just got to make the grind he is just harassing strangers yeah fair play to give give them all you know and if he hit if he hits a a stranger with a knife you know look that is a bad day but he is just got to pick himself up and go go off like what what is the law around that can like anyone just go around juggling knives or do you have to have like a permit i

we have none left but it should be grand anyway just go and do it go fish 0 was that when was that that was 2 like 2 summers 3 summers ago were we remember we were we were fishing at the was that the shop at the yeah we we went down there to get one and then they were like 0 yeah yeah they were like you can just fish do not need a license yeah that is cool just do it yeah we do not care one time me and another mate that you know were fishing down at the river there and some lad came up to us and he was like do you have your licenses and we were like ah yeah yeah yeah we were like ah yeah yeah we just did not and he was like 0 that is good that is good and he did not even ask for us to show them he just asked if we had it it was so what was he an inspector or he just kind of random local i think he was just like a local fisherman but he was part of like the whole fisherman the community thing 0 yeah yeah he probably would have been like a head honcho there you know he was an enforcer yeah yeah ah you would not want to mess with him there you would not you know he was 80 years old but he was packing like serious muscle ı tell you you would end up in the water man yeah i know last time i went fishing though i did not catch anything my dad caught 5 so it was kind of shite and they were pretty big ones pretty big roach yeah i am not going to lie i was pretty jealous it sucks when you are sitting there for 56 hours and you do not catch anything but the person which you catches like a shit ton yeah it is just like ugh what am i doing wrong especially when you are doing like the exact same thing did you eat the fish afterwards or did you throw them back no we throw them back sure i am like fishing is kind of a weird thing like you kind like yeah yeah it is kind weird when you think about it but once you catch a fish that goes right out the window because there is just so much fun you just kinda lose all morals really i saw some video of some guy who was like doing this bird thing where he would catch birds in nets and then he would like tag them and then check their wings and stuff he is like a biologist but then like somebody was like in the comments they were like imagine being the bird and then like trying to tell your friends afterwards what happened to you and they would not believe you you say you are going around one day and some dude grabs you and puts this t thing on your leg and then like he he he kept on them putting them into like tubs and then weighing them that is their version of like being like in a ufo or something you know 0 for sure yeah yeah that is an interesting hypothesis like maybe there is a people out there who are like doing that to pick humans like there is like some species out there and then they are like no one believes me no well let us be honest conor we both know that aliens and bigfoot are real so yeah we have plenty of evidence but we can not disclose it in this current forum but it is a we have just evidence that is so convincing yeah yeah yeah that is what they always kind of do though is not it it is like no you got to believe me now i can not show you this cause it is classified you know you know those scam ads you get where they are like they are like telling you today they can make you a bunch of money but then they are like you got to keep on watching to the end of the video they can never give you the good information on these are the 3 steps you have to take yeah but like i am going to leave that right to the end and you know i there have been times where i have watched a whole of video cause i i find those kind of scams really amusing and like what they usually always do is they are always like yeah there is 3 there is thee top tips to making 6 figures in in a week or whatever then they are like they will be like keep on watching for you to find out more information then they will speak for 10 minutes then about some random stuff and then they are like now if you want to find out

in my head that like you have wasted so much time you almost feel like you want to just go and find out what the 3 things are but they hyped it up so much and so anyway you feel like you feel like getting into your head every time you are like no it is kind of like that scientology thing like apparently there is all these different levels to it yeah they kind of get you in and they get you bound yeah with the more money you spend like the more like information they disclose you to but like the religion i do not know it is kind of tricky yeah i imagine you like put a bunch of money into it and you realize it was all true you were like damn like it all makes sense even that the fact to get to spend money you are kind of like damn it all makes total sense and like nobody will ever believe me ooh yeah what if there is like yeah what if like do you know the whole like cause people sort of know the story of it but what if like that is not the actual story what if there there has got to be a reason why tom cruise is in it you know that is true he is known for his reasonable opinions yeah he is pretty badass i will give him that there is a i do not know i i would i would not mind starting a cult one day yeah yeah but like i would i would definitely have one of those coded books like that like that one that we were talking about yeah you got you got to it is like it is not
